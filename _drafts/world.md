World Trip.

—— check with all people mentioned in the articles to get their permission if it is okay i use their stories…

Disclaimer: All opinions are my own. I was not paid to do this article. A few people asked me to write about my trip. I am happy to do it and share personal experiences.

tl;dr version - Try to complete part one if limited on time or attention. Part two will be long, story-like, and deeply personal.

23 countries, 51 cities, 31,600 miles, 6 months, 7000 photos, and $14,000 later. I traveled the world and I can now look back and say I did it <i>my</i> way.

PART ONE:

My route.[1]

What I packed.

Backpack.
Luggage.

Crazy moments.

At one residence, I got kicked out because I refused to inhabit while nude. In Prague, a scammer duped me into giving him change for an identical, but different country’s currency which carried no value. I was shortchanged $100. The Paris terrorist attacks happened a week after I left. A fellow backpacker I met along the way had all of his electronics and identifications stolen during his hostel stay, which ended his trip early.

How much did it cost?

I could only account for $12,600 of expenses from my bank account. The real total trip cost was probably between $13,000 and $14,000. See detailed transactions.

How did I discover things to do?

Wikipedia: List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites[6].
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_World_Heritage_Sites 

I used TripAdvisor. Googling, “TripAdvisor Top 10 Things To Do In (given city)” is a good place to start for finding activities. The TripAdvisor results are filtered showing highest rated activities first. I have found the Traveler’s Choice award, certificates of excellence, and number of reviews to be indicators of good activities as well. Many of the TripAdvisor “Things To Do” are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The internet, blogs, travel sites, and UNESCO are certainly reliable sources, however talking to locals, hosts, and fellow travelers is equally beneficial for discovering activities.

How did I get around?

I flew. I discovered flights using Google Flights(flights.google.com)[7]. I rode the bus with Megabus and Meinfeinbus[8]. I used rideshare with BlaBlaCar[9]. I considered a 3 month EuroStar train pass, but I decided against it[10].

How did I find accommodation?

I always checked these 5 sites before I booked a stay in a new city: hostelbookers.com, hostelworld.com, booking.com, airbnb.com, and couchsurfing.org (free)[11].

Insurance, Identification, and Immunization Must-Haves.

International Travelers Insurance(https://www.geico.com/travel-insurance/) is a comprehensive package from GEICO covering medical & dental expenses, flight or trip cancellation for any reason, lost luggage, lost identification or theft, or car rental collision coverage.

It is a good idea to obtain an international driver’s license(http://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpapplc.html) issued by the AAA prior to traveling abroad. This can be used for international driving and car rentals.

Obtain duplicates of the passport, United States driver’s license, school id, social security card, international travellers insurance proof, debit card, credit card, and any other critical documents. Keep one set in a backpack and another elsewhere, in concealed fanny pack for example. In the event one set is lost, there is a backup so missed flights, unwanted examinations, and other bad things are avoided. This concept holds true for electronics too. A backup dummy mobile phone, if a smartphone is lost. Or a tablet, in case a laptop is lost.

[1] My trip started with the 11 hour flight from San Francisco to Munich. It continued on tracing points A-J, A-J, A-C, and so on. The bluelines indicate ground transportation. Blacklines indicate air travel. The trip ends with the flight from Tokyo to Chicago. All my bus tickets. <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fijl2rjluhh20km/AAAKmQY4aPodhacBZi5HddPxa?dl=0>. Created using Google My Maps.
[2] Equipment I wish I had along: a Canon DSLR and a drone. Luggage
-roughly two weeks of cloths
[2] I estimated the trip would cost $12,000. So, I overspent slightly. I started with $15,000. I returned home with less than $1000 in my bank account. ATM & currency fees are inevitable. $250 in fees is nominal for a $12,000 budget. I ignored credit card data when calculating total trip cost because my credit account was functioning as a subsidiary of my debit account. 
[3] A common question I received was, “How many days do I need to explore (given city)?” I answered this question with the ‘Days Needed’ column. Language was the most overwhelming factor traveling from city to city each week. With no previous knowledge, I struggled communicating.
[4] Red indicates extremely hot or cold temperatures, excessive precipitation, humidity, low number of sunlight hours per day, and or pollution. Green indicates mild or warm temperatures, dry, clear skies, clean air, and many hours of sunlight per day.

This chart optimized for mild and sunny weather. If snow or any abnormal weather is the goal the chart is inappropriate.

Some destinations shut down seasonally. I wanted to visit Switzerland in November. But, the Alps shutdown November to February due to heavy snow. I made a planning mistake.

Don't forget, the seasons in the southern hemisphere are opposite of the northern hemisphere caused by the tilt and orbit of the Earth.

Seasons of the southern hemisphere:

Summer: December to February.
Autumn: March to May.
Winter: June to August.
Spring: September to November.

[5] A great resource for understanding entry into ANY foreign territory. Use cases on my trip: 
Entry into the European Union (Schengen Area) - 90 day limit
Entry into India - 30 day Indian eVisa required. Must submit application at least 4 days before your flight departs for India. Must produce a friend’s address in India to be permitted in.
Entry into China - mainland China requires a valid Visa prior to trip. No visa is required for Hong Kong and Macau.

[6] A powerful collection of the most extraordinary places on Earth.
[7] Google Flights is a simple and easy tool to find the best flights.

How to navigate Google Flights:

Enter starting point and destination point.
If the dates are flexible click the calendar and browse month to month to find the best prices.
If the location is flexible click the map and browse region to region to find the best prices.
If a traveler is time and location flexible, extremely cheap flights are common.

If a traveler is flexible in one or the other, but not both, cheap flights are less common.

Best Budget Airline Brands

US - Spirit Airlines
Europe - Norwegian Air, RyanAir, EasyJet
Asia - Asean Air, AirAsia, HK Express (Hong Kong), Peach (Korea and Japan)
India - SpiceJet, AirIndia, Indigo

RyanAir flights in Europe are usually under $100. My best example was a round-trip flight from Barcelona to Ibiza for $20.

[8] MegaBus is a good quality, low-cost charter bus service from city to city. It works similarly in the United States. Route availability mostly covers Western Europe. Meinfeinbus is Europe’s version of MegaBus. Similar in quality, price, and destinations. Route availability mostly covers Western and Central Europe. I always booked overnight bus rides. Instead of sleeping at a hostel, I slept on the bus so my accommodation and transportation expense was the cost of my bus ticket.
[9] BlaBlaCar is similar to Uber, however a ride comparable in distance from San Francisco to Los Angeles (8 hours) would only cost $30 in Europe. I would use BlaBlaCar if it were in the United States.

Best Ridesharing Options

Europe - BlaBlaCar, Uber. 
Middle East - Uber. 
India - Uber (cheap, $1 for 10 minute ride), GrabTaxi, Ryde. 
China - Uber. 
South Korea & Japan - Uber

[10] I did not want to solely rely on trains to get from place to place in Europe. I would have felt constrained as the Eurostar pass only works for certain routes and regions in Europe. Also, the Eurostar pass does not give you high speed rail access as sometimes advertised. A mix of flights, buses, ridesharing, and trains allowed total flexibility.
[11] Navigating these sites is straight-forward. Enter location and dates. I sorted the results by price low to high. Exceptional Hostels I Stayed At: Fifth Hostel in Budapest, Gracia City Hostel in Barcaelona, and MadPackers in Delhi, India.

PART 2

Why did I do it? What inspired me?
I had 2 simple motivations. I wanted to further understand people who are different than me and I wanted to learn more about how the world works.

A few times in my life my world view changed substantially. Like when I interned in San Francisco. I hoped my trip around the world would change me as well in ways I could not previously foresee. 

The future of what? The future of modern architecture, design, civil engineering lies in Tokyo, the future of spirituality and community lies in India, the future of shipping and transportation lies in places like Rotterdam and Hong Kong, the future of solidarity and meditation lies in Japanese culture, the history of the United States lies in Italy and Western Europe, the future of hardware engineering lies in Asia, the future of lifestyle and hospitality lies in Spain, the future of monetary economics may lie in Scandinavia or Japan, the future of recreational drug use and sexual liberation may lie in the Netherlands, the history of Western Imperialism lies in Bombay, India, the history of equality, the Bill of Rights, and political revolution lie in France, the history of religion lies in Rome and Jerusalem, and much more.

I was scared. I did not know if I would make it home safe, or if I would have enough money, or if I would ever return to the United States.

What allowed me to take the trip?
Temporarily living in San Francisco, California was a major step towards opening my mind to the rest of the world. My parents played a role in allowing me to go, after being skeptical at first. I had no commitments. No job, no school, no spouse or children to care for, just a wide open calendar and a motivation to explore.

My trip was entirely spontaneous. I booked my flight to Europe 1 month before departing. After that, I never planned further than 1 week out.

Did I go alone? 
I did. It might have been easier to go with an American friend, but I was forced to meet other travellers, locals, and new friends along the way.

Was I Homesick?
Of course. I wanted to be back in the United States where I ’feel’ safe. Where I am close to my family who will protect me. Where I can enjoy my friends. Where people look like me and speak like me. I wanted to have my own private room. I wanted access to a car. I wanted to work out and be a productive individual. I wanted to eat normal American food, the way I like it cooked. I wanted eggs, bacon, pancakes, and hash browns. I wanted buffalo chicken wings. I was hangry. I was deprived of my American indulgences.

Traveling abroad, I found out the hard way life is easiest in the United States. Access to clean water, plentiful food, no pollution, and the best technology. These gifts are not 

Having a unique experience.
If you do everything everyone tells you, your experience probably won't be unique, listening to your own travel desires is primary.

Understanding and appreciating things on the trip.
Read read read --before, during, and after... about historical places while you are there, points of interest, pamphlets, magazines, audio tours, anything you can get your hands on. Increases memory retention for each experience and improves gratitude for each destination. At tourist attractions like museums, palaces, and other safe attractions, be willing to venture off the beaten path. Many times you wont find anything of value, but every once in a while you will find a gem. Experience it in solitude.

I used my smartphone frequently to look things up on Google. Understanding the story of why something exists or how it came to be enhances it's beauty.

Have an appreciation for the beauty & simplicity of the adventures you go on. The trip can become work and drudgery if it is not appreciated. The adventures can be equally draining mentally and physically.

Most of the joy I experience came from understanding the historical significance of a given place.

Capturing the moment with technology can actually contribute to the perfect experience. I often found myself immersed in the moment, experiencing sensory overload, but before the moment disappear I tried capturing the moment with technology.

Avoiding Bad Outcomes.
Try the local cuisine.

Immerse and imitate the culture.

Watch how other people act.

Assume your always being targeted as outsider. Attracting unwanted attention is never good. Your going to get in trouble or insult a local or getting kidnapped, going to prison. Dont be an attention-seeker and you will be safe.

People staring is not always a bad sign. Most of the time they are trying to understand us because we are different. If someone bumps into you though, be skeptical. It could be a pickpocket. When your on a budget, stolen items may lead to a premature end to the trip. Be alert if someone is trailing you or walking straight at you. Paying attention and showing strangers you are aware of your surroundings is a good deterrent for bad outcomes. Exhibiting cluelessness is dangerous. Sure, I was scared, helpless, and clueless many times during my trip but I would bet most observers never noticed. I always slept with my backpack at hostels because my IDs, electronics, and valuables were stashed in there. I never trusted the lockers they offer because they could be broken into or previously tampered with. 

\\Be vigilant when in public places and around large crowds.

Look for hostels that are centrally located with access to public transit. This will give you a lot of options for access to points of interest.

Managing psychology.
Take breaks - psychological rejuvenation. If you go too fast you wont be able to debrief and remember it.

Taking rest days where I did not do anything but lay in bed and watched TV or movies helped me greatly. Being out and about is draining and its strategically more important to be excited about what comes next rather than burning out. My typical week included 3 days of intense exploring, touristy things, eating out, etc. for every 4 days of rest. It is also not financially sustainable to being doing things 7 days a week. It is unlikely to be able to digest and remember all of the activities going hard 7 days a week.

Walking tours are especially great, the tour guide acts as protector, you get to learn new things, you have the ability to meet new friends in your tour group, and walking & learning is stimulating. A good two hour tour costs roughly $10-15.

The most difficult thing is probably integrating with the people but its a really healthy and beneficial thing to do.

Locals who can speak both the native language and English are probably the most helpful. They are liaisons and can really add a lot of value to your experience. Its a good idea to keep them around.

Always have a local in your contacts. If you get in trouble, they can translate for you.

Public transit like trains, subways, and metros are usually a great way to get around because they will have signs in English.

SAFETY
Safety in general globally. No guns. The more you get used to an area the safer you feel.

Look for great communities when it comes to hostels. Barcelona hostels. Makes all he difference. Big hostels vs. small hostels.

I tried to take hard cover books on the trip. It was a terrible idea. Using eBooks is best.

Random Thoughts.
Some museums in Europe are free after 5pm if you are under 25 years old. Ask.

A Student ID works everywhere in Europe for discounts. Get one.

Use VPN abroad. Without it, Netflix will not work. Foreign ads will be annoying. Certain websites and applications will not be accesible.

The 24-hour clock (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock) or Military Time is common abroad. It is a superior system of time to the 12-hour clock. The metric system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system) is common as well and is a superior system of measurement to the Imperial system.

Mobile internet can be difficult to obtain abroad. US telecommunication companies generally do not offer global packages. But, I used T-Mobile’s Simply Global package which offers coverage in 247 countries around the world. I always had access to 3G data speeds. 4G speeds are extremely rare abroad. The other option is to sign up with a new carrier in each individual country.

I communicated with my family and friends using FaceTime and Skype with free video communication. I used WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger with free text messaging.

Here is the apps I used:
Couchsurfing meet ups Add other travelers on facebook & social media. Stay in contact. Follow their trips to learn. Facebook groups for expiats & meep ups

Your going to have a lot of downtime, buses, airplanes, trains, driving. Etc.
