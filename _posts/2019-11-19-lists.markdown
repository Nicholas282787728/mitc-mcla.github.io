**/about**

Hi, my name is Mitch McLaughlin.

A few years ago, I dropped out of university (2016). While in school, I studied computer science and finance, played Division 1 basketball, and interned at GoPro(most recent), Oracle, and Nike.

Immediately after leaving school, I traveled the world for 6 months.

I am not completely sure what I will do the rest of my life. But, a few things I enjoy are: building things, reading and writing, language, art & culture, bioinformatics, bioengineering, _ _ **economics, software** _ _, exercising, and having fun.

I am fluent in English, computer software, math, music, dance, ebonics, body language, and emoji.
