**plan on 1/1/2020**

I just wanna say I’m going to start using words and phrases such as “I want to” or “I plan on” doing x, y, z. I think things in the near term, like a day out are more likely to happen than say a week out or a month out. But, you get the idea, honestly, at a certain point I might just have to go with the flow on some decisions.

**Notice 12/19/2019**

Notice: text messages will be posted shortly. Take any necessary steps in preparation. If you need to unfollow my account/posts/stories and refollow in a few days when the dust settles, go ahead. Unfollowing will prevent you from seeing any notifications from me in the interim. If you need a liberal friend to filter through the images first, may not be a bad idea. I will hide the images from my timeline immediately and post them to a photo album to reduce accidental exposure and to introduce a hurdle to get to them.

**Social Media Protocols & Beyond 12/16/2019**

In response to Jack Dorsey’s recent tweet, taking a courageous step to begin working on an open and decentralized standard for social media (see link to his tweet below). I have just attached a picture of my ideas for a similar/related project I call “an open-source software protocol” (see my pic attached below). Which was originally written by me in April 2017, and comes from my private iOS notes which I have already published here on Facebook and on my website. My goal for publishing these ideas is I hope it will influence his project but more broadly Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and all these social media platforms, even Bitcoin, our internet, their thinking, development and direction for the future which I care so much about.

What’s interesting about where I have now posted these ideas is they are on a website called PrivateBin. PrivateBin is a website that no company owns. I dislike posting on Facebook generally because that means they own my data. With this paper being posted on PrivateBin (see link below), no single person or company owns the document. It simply belongs to the internet or the community of all of us people. There’s no profit motive. Anyway’s I hope this is well received and look forward to the discussion.

**A quick thank you...12/3/2019**

It’s been really great being back here in Iowa. And I’ve been thinking a lot about what makes this place, and more broadly the heartland here in America, special. I think the ideal life is to grow up get a normal job, have a normal family, and have close/meaningful relationships. That seems to be the only requirements for a dope life, which is how it should be. There’s a *real* sense of community. I don’t really recall many folks “having an agenda” here. What you get is usually what you’ve earned. There’s not many distractions. Folks work together and cooperate. People are 100% real. Sports are a part of life. The black, white, and hispanic folks are the most normal and real here that I’ve seen anywhere. People have the right values like, family, hard working, integrity, etc. Everything is just pretty normal and I think that’s why things function so well. All of this seems simple and obvious, but unfortunately it’s not like that everywhere for whatever reason.

Finally, I’ve been pleasantly surprised how the people around here have doubled down on their values and principles. And I just wanna share I will always be thankful. I feel really blessed. Thank you.🙏🏼

**campfire lyrics 09/19/2019**

our journey comes to an end with music of drama

one specific frequency to effect the way we behave

*it’s too random...* specific at extremely low frequencies

but generally what you hear on the radio is terrible

i think basically it’s a product and the reason it is being 

manufactured is just to make money and it seems to me to have very little to do with, um, the basic reasons for making music in the first place

we’ll show you on energy on, on ground tracks, NAV is go, copy endeavor runway in sight

on this side we have some widely contrasting examples taken from recent recordings, to give you some idea of the wealth of recorded music now available on the wider tapestry of stereophonic sound.. we hope you’ve enjoyed this journey through sound....! ❤️

I want to share a few things...

These seem obvious but just want to make sure it’s been stated.

I want you to know if you are reading this, you should never *ever* worry about being remembered. You will be...! We are getting close to a special, special place and it feels like it will happen sooner than later. I don’t know what this place look/feels like quite yet. But, it’s going to be really incredible. I’m really excited.

Everything you do matters...! Really cliche, but more true than ever now. Be careful!!! I find myself revisiting the most basic stuff everyday, I guess that’s how things go these days.

Stay positive, please, really begging you.

I’m spending a good chunk of my time decoding things. If communication is to be clear and precise, I need phone numbers!! Ladies, this is not an invitation.

Stick with me, I’m trying...! Always trust yourself 🙏🏼


**** in fact, if somethings unclear, it might not even be worth sharing





I’m awake usually 16 hrs/day (102 hr/week). I go to the gym for 1-2 hrs, 3 days a week (5 hrs/week). I play basketball for 3-4 hours, 3 times a week (11 hrs/week). I need a few hours to chill per day generally (11 hrs/wk). I drive for uber one day a week usually for 8-10 hrs in one day. Add all that up, add in some hours for multitasking, and thats only roughly 60-80 working hours. I need to eat, healthy food. Sometimes I cook which requires time. I need to shower. I have housemates. I do my own laundry weekly. I like to dress up sometimes, but rarely get to because it takes time, and I’m usually living out of a suitcase. I’m $30k in debt. I never had a paycheck ever in my life and have never been in debt like this until recently. I have friends I like to see sometimes. I travel to see my family 3-4 times a year. While traveling things are a bit crazy. I have to do most of the things a normal, average person would do every day/week at the moment.

So, 60 working hours a week if I’m lucky.

I rarely have time to think about image because I’m just trying to keep everything in order.

Just 3 years ago, I was seriously a nobody. Just an average dude walking around.

I just found out like 3 weeks ago that I was VIP.

The last 3 weeks has seriously been a complete blur. I don’t know what’s happening. I rarely know what day of the week it is. Time is just a blur to me.

I’m going to start having to take alot of drugs just to survive on the daily. I’ve never taken drugs like this until recently. I don’t like doing drugs. Drugs are really unpredictable. Especially the newer ones.

**if im not fed, ill be in a bad mood

*** Let me know if anything I said is wrong or out of line.

**Love & Marriage 08/23/2019**

modern love nytimes

http://www.chronicle.com/article/I-Have-Multiple-Loves-/239077

Marriage. I've been thinking a lot lately about marriage. I always had questions but now they are deeper. Generally, you grow up optimistic about marriage & it exists as a vague event far out on the horizon. Everyone marries for different reasons & at different ages. Personally, I began to ask questions in my 20's. How do I find someone to marry? What's the point of a wedding? But, more recently my questions have been,  is marriage a necessity? Do I have to be religious to get married? Once you have a kid, do you have to get married? (Write a related post about kids lol.) What happens if it's not for me? Or even worse, what happens if I get divorced😱? These are all hard questions because I don't know if marriage is right for me.

Today there are a lot of people who marriage works for! This is great. I'm thankful my parents have been married for 30+ years. But the problem is a large majority of folks who it doesn't work for.

And the problem with marriage isn't people, it's the institution. But somehow couples gets publicly shamed for divorce.

Marriage is an inherently old tradition. The world is changing fast. Take everything great about marriage and practice it. Instead of a wedding, have a fun celebration that takes all of the fun things from a wedding but no rituals. The best thing about this, is should things not work out in the relationship of the couple, you never had the chance of deceiving the guests. This will save a lot of embarrassment & unnecessary gossip. Simply by removing the rituals. Imagine this, couple throws a (noun for non-marriage party) everything goes great on that day, months later things change & couple separates. I imagine the congregation saying, "well at least it was one hell of a party". And that's the way it should be. No one should actually care if the couple stays together or not. Because relationships are highly personal.

Today, people are partially deceived into thinking they have to have a wedding or get married. Truth is you can create whatever life you want.

Better yet, later on if a couple wants to be officially married do it privately with the church. But it's healthy to acknowledge the celebration/party and the religious tradition of a wedding don't mix.

Assuming the economy is stable and holding all other factors stable, we will begin to see a shift away from marriage. Love is not ending, but the institution is heavy, and the environment requires agility.

Bell curve of successful marriages/relationships.

The best systems always allow human nature freedom not forcing human nature into a defined area. Relationships should allow this same flexibility.

Life expectancy has big implications for the delay of marriage.

I'm still young and naive.. I think. But, these are real things as a 23 year old.

I'm 23 years old, and these are my thoughts on marriage.
One night stands: it might happen. Not the best idea.

Capitalist Dating

I do not know if the trend is good or bad. But, it is.

Whether your single or married, make the best with what you have.

As more & more women are single and can economically sustainable the only reason love will exist is sex & companionship.
Modern markets also allow women to play a greater economic role, which lead to their greater independence. And the expansion ofdemocracy, with its emphasis on liberty and individual choice, may also have stacked the deck for love matches.
Polyamory will become more common.
 "We now believe it is based on love, mutual sexual attraction, equality and a flexible division of labor." Can exist between multiple partners.

Monogamy may seem central to marriage now, but in fact, polygamy was common throughout history. From Jacob, to Kings David and Solomon, Biblical men often had anywhere from two to thousands of http://www.livescience.com/37777-history-of-wives.
marriage.html
At this opposite extreme are the likes of basketball player Wilt Chamberlain, who claimed to have slept with 20,000 women.

Sex often brings with it confusion about what the partner ultimately seeks in terms of a relationship. "A sexual encounter occurs, and one partner assumes it has meaning and endurance and the other partner never assumed that from the beginning," Smith said.

http://www.livescience.com/16465-monogamy-polygamy-human-behavior.html

The catholic church fabricated monogamy as an institution in the 9th century. Prior to this, polygamy was often practiced.

The only thing that matters in a modern relationship are trust and sexual attraction.

But, maybe marriage is not for me.

**Q 08-18-2019**

feynman quote...

Man can fail. They can be caught, killed, & forgotten. But an idea cannot. 400 years later, an idea can still change the world.

There is a face beneath this mask. But it's not me. I am no more the face than the muscles beneath it or the bones beneath them.

Beneath this mask, there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Cready. And ideas are bulletproof.

Who was he? He was Edmund Dantes. He was my father, and my mother; My brother, my friend, he was you and me. He was all of us.

Fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words they are perspectives.

People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.

The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements.” - Nikola Tesla

The miracle of your mind is that you can see the world as it isn't. We can imagine the future, we can remember the past.

The miracle of your mind is that you can see the world as it isn't. We can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place.

We need to think big, we need to think cheap, we need to think about the problem differently.

We owe it to our children & grandchildren.

We can't just bomb our way out, were gunna invent our way out, working together.

We have the tools, we have the passion; we can be more, we can be much more.

The city of the future calls on you, to see it thru, will you dream with me, will you build with me?

We have 3 billion new minds coming online, to do that which we must do.

The value and veracity as such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and virtuous... I don't play God and I don't believe in coincidence.

BNC Video

I do appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine, the security of the familiar, the tranquility & the repetition. I enjoy them as much as anyone. But in the spirit of commemoration, which are associated with important events in the past, someone's death, some bloody struggle, are celebrated with a nice holiday... There are those who do not want us to speak. Orders are being shouted into telephones & men with guns are on their way. Why? Because why the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always remain their power. Words are the means to meaning. And for those who will listen the annunciation of truth. And the truth is there is something terribly wrong with this country. Cruelty and injustice intolerance and oppression and once you have the freedom to object, to think & speak as you saw fit, you now have senses, and systems of set silence coercing your conformity and subversing your submission... Those will be held accountable. If you are looking for the guilty you need only to look into a mirror... There are a million reasons why they rob you and try to corrupt you of your common sense, fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the high chancellor. He promised order & peace, and in return all he asked was your silent obedience & consent... Fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words they are perspectives.

***Regardless of how much sensor ship is placed on a society, fairness, justice, and freedom will be everlasting. Perspectives cannot be destroyed and cannot be forgotten.

Blowing up the parliament will solve everything? No certainty, only opp.

People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.

A building is a symbol, as is the symbol of destroying it. A symbol is powerful with a bunch of people behind it. It can change the world.

Artists use lies to tell the truth while politicians use lies to cover them up.

By the power of truth, I, while living have conquered the universe.
From Faust, trying to cheat the devil

Oppenheimer was able to change more than the course of just a war, he changed the entire course of human history.

I have not come for what you hoped to do, I have come for what you did.

There are no coincidences, only the illusion of coincidences.

My father wouldn't look at me, he told me to go and never come back, my mother wouldn't look at me. But I only told them the truth. Was that so selfish? Our integrity sells for so little but it's all we really have. It's the very last inch we have. But in that inch we are free.

Words are power.

Different became dangerous. I don't understand why they hate us so much.

I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish, but one inch. It is small and it is fragile, and it is the only thing in the world worth having. You must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us.

Even though I do not know you, even though I may not meet you, lust with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you, with all my heart. I love you. Valerie.

You have no fear anymore. You are completely free.

What was done to me created me. That's a basic principal of the universe. Every action creates an opposite and equal reaction.

There is a face beneath this mask. But it's not me. I am no more the face than the muscles beneath it or the bones beneath them.

Beneath this mask, there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Cready. And ideas are bulletproof.

Who was he? He was Edmund Dantes. He was my father, and my mother; My brother, my friend, he was you and me. He was all of us.







Summary 

words will always remain their power. Words are the means to meaning. And for those who will listen the annunciation of truth. 

Fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words they are perspectives.

***Regardless of how much sensorship is placed on a society, fairness, justice, and freedom will be everlasting. Perspectives cannot be destroyed and cannot be forgotten.

Our integrity sells for so little but it's all we really have. It's the very last inch we have. But in that inch we are free.

I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish, but one inch. It is small and it is fragile, and it is the only thing in the world worth having. You must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us.

**Benefits Of Writing 07/21/2019**

http://lifehacker.com/the-psychological-benefits-of-writing-regularly-1783693547

https://www.helpscout.net/blog/benefits-of-writing/

https://www.helpscout.net/blog/creative-cringe/


The Therapeutic Aspects of Writing

Much of the research on writing and happiness deals with “expressive writing,” or jotting down what you think and how you feel. Even blogging “undoubtedly affords similar benefits” to private expressive writing in terms of therapeutic value.
Expressive writing has also been linked to improved mood, well-being, and reduced stress levels for those who do it regularly, says 

Adam Grant:
“Research by Laura King shows that writing about achieving future goals and dreams can make people happier and healthier... And Jane Dutton and I found that when people doing stressful fundraising jobs kept a journal for a few days about how their work made a difference, they increased their hourly effort by 29% over the next two weeks.”
Moreover, laziness with words creates difficulty in describing feelings, sharing experiences, and communicating with others. Being able to flesh out thoughts in your mind only to have them come stumbling out when you speak is supremely frustrating. Fortunately, regular writing seems to offer some reprieve.
In both emotional intelligence and in hard sciences like mathematics, writinghas been shown to help people communicate highly complex ideas more effectively. Writing helps eliminate “it sounded good in my head” by forcing your hand; brains forgive fuzzy abstractions, prose does not.


Writing and Gratitude

As the authors of one study noted, subjects who reflected on the good things in their life once a week by writing them down were more positive and motivated about their current situations and their futures.
The catch was, when they wrote about them every day, the benefits were minimal. This makes sense; any activity can feel disingenuous and just plain boring if done too often. It seems like the key is to reflect and write about gratitude regularly, but not begrudgingly often.

Writing and Learning

Information often sticks better when it’s learned as though it needs to be taught or re-written in your own words. This concept of having a “writer’s ear” never fully clicked with me until I started writing regularly.
There’s a certain discipline required to create interesting written work that demands the individual be receptive and focused on finding new sources of information, inspiration, and insight. I’ve read books, listened to podcasts/radio, and watched videos I would normally have put off in order to learn something new so that I might write about later.
Simply being a curator of good ideas encourages deeper thinking, research, and “heading down the rabbit hole” in order to find unique takes on topics that matter to you. Committing to creating a volume of work also allows you to tackle big ideas more effectively.
Writing around a certain topic for some time will allow you to build off of older thoughts, utilizing what you’ve already written to develop ideas on a grander scale—I’m sure many writers have written a paragraph that lead to an essay, which lead to a series of articles, which lead to a book.

Writing as Leadership at Scale

Though the world may now be drowning under the “personal brand” deluge, there are sincerely interesting opportunities that an “anyone can publish” world brings about.
The ability to leave an impact at scale through your words alone is an astounding concept. There’s a bit of a creative shock the first time someone emails you, thanking you for the work you’ve put out and sharing how it has helped or influenced them.
Without a doubt, the positive feedback for this “leadership at scale” leads to gratitude and further motivation for the writer.
Even in the face of criticism, writers learn to build thick skins like few others. Criticism, even unwarranted, is the breakfast of champions.

“The writer, having tossed up some suitably interesting pins, knows they have to come down, and, in my experience, the greatest pleasure in writing fiction is when they come down in a surprising way that conveys more and better meaning than you’d had any idea was possible. One of the new pleasures I experienced writing this, my first novel, was simply that the pins were more numerous, stayed in the air longer, and landed in ways that were more unforeseen and complexly instructive to me than has happened in shorter works.”

“I’m not responsible for your life, you are.

Bye take care I wish you well”

Im not sure how my life has gotten off the wrong track. But, it has. I don’t feel well anymore. I feel overwhelmed. I feel sick, everyday. I don’t feel human. I’m never myself anymore. And I’m so sorry for all this.

I can’t go on in pain anymore.

I will always appreciate the times we had together. I love you forever. Please be well.

micah whats your problem? no one thinks there cooler than anyone, you lost. were all moving on with our lives, nobody cares (i certainly dont), life isnt about winning and losing. i have other more important goals in life than “beating” other people like helping society and i plan on accomplishing those goals. if you wanna be a good friend and contribute with positive energy, make some lifestyle changes. i’ve told u over and over to stop being a psycho and u wont, at first it was funny since then its been really really bad. i repeat myself all the time to you, especially with the bitcoin stuff. after a while it’s very disrespectful to me and everything ive worked for in my life. u keep digging yourself a deeper hole, not sure why, do the right thing man. i hope u make lots of money off bitcoin, i could care less. the real problem with all of this is your actually ruining my life because all u worry about is bitcoin and u think its gunna solve all your problems. go read a book or something, wake the fuck up, figure things out for yourself. and if u think moneys gunna solve all your problems your a retard. money doesnt do anything, it might actually make life worse. figure out your life man, im tired of it. your ruining our friendship with the bitcoin stuff, its really sad.

i dont have a problem with this text group but i cant always respond nor do i want to, sometimes i dont mind acting like a retard with Tourettes but i also want to be normal person doing work sometimes too. ive been with my family, who i rarely see, and are getting older fast, so im trying to spend quality time with them instead of reading these wild conspiracy theories you throw out all the time.

**Negotiation Strategy 11/17/2017**

Johnny————— 

How am I being compensated if we take top down approach:

“Here is our investment thesis and this is how we make picks” only revealing they need to know at a minimum.




Culturally - How are we defining culture?

Culturally I’m not comfortable going out and meeting folks and telling them this is our team and they're great when it is not true.

At the end of the day, I have to go to Alyse and everyone I meet and tell them this is Johnny and this is Archie and I recommend them.

I am seriously considering leaving the project, I am not going to fight over politics in order to be compensated fairly.

We are going to do things the right way. Start over.

/*I have got enough connections at this point to basically do whatever I want.*/

We operate under full transparency. I have complete control over what happens. Compensation is 

If we operate under “only what you need to know” outlook.

If we operate with full transparency and openness


Piece-wise, only reveal to Archie and johnny what they need to know to move forward.

Give archie a big share of the profits

35% archie 35% mitch remaining 40%

Voting

Mitch 60% remaining 40%

Archie actually has not done much.

-Hanieh Consensys

-

Short-term profits have to be agreed upon.

It is about what is actually about happening behind the scenes.

It is about being honest about who is actually driving the value.

Everyone is going to be listening to me at the end of the day.

Never be exposed for lack of preparation.

At the end of the day, I have to go to Alyse and everyone I meet and tell them this is Johnny and this is Archie and I recommend them.

My reputation is on the line. I want to operate under full-transparency.

“If you want to be apart of this, this is how we are going to operate”


Peita——————— 

Culturally, I do not think it is smart at this point to operate under only secrecy. That is old way of thinking and does not produce the best results.

I’d prefer we do bottom-up approach and structure the MOU the correct honest way.

Open salaries. Open everything. Completely flat organization. Not hierarchical.

I am going to approach Johnny and say we are not going to operate in a hierarchical manner.

—————————

How we talk to LPs has implications for our culture.

You said culture is important…

1. Is culture only important to you when it strategically makes sense for your interests?

2.Transparency and fairness

Define why we went with 25% splits in the first place?


Hey man,

Can you and I have a call today to discuss the MOU after yesterday’s calls?

-Mitch

At a minimum move forward on profit sharing.

**An Anonymity Protocol: 11/04/2017**

1. Acquire prepaid gift cards

- burner phone (buy new, unlocked)

- burner laptop (buy new, nothing preinstalled)

- use burner internet (public wifi)

- designate and borrow workspace (only do work in this location) preferably a public place with public wifi and not connected in anyway to your identity (can be in the same city but the farther away the better)

Configure laptop settings (offline)

Using the laptop:

- custom build a vpn (using a public wifi network)

Using the vpn (create a virtual pseudo person):

- set up an anonymous email

- create anonymous accounts for any internet service you may need

- when needed: accumulate reputation under a pseudonym (blogs, Reddit, forums, etc)

If we were to do a token for the hedgefund under a pseudonym:

2. Write the token white paper under the pseudonym

- utility

- execute all the steps to be listed on an exchange (using the public wifi, using the virtual person, using burner hardware, using the borrowed workspace)

- execute all the steps to be listed on CoinMarketCap

3. Grow the fund

- Create a public facing website (using the virtual person) with dashboards on the historical performance of the speculative value and the performance of the individual cryptocurrency and ico picks. The purpose of this is to attract more capital.

4. Exiting the project

- if people start to get uncomfortably close to an identity, leave the project, never speak about it again, destroy all burner hardware and electronic evidence

- take your coins and run? lol

To wipe these messages and all signal messages at anytime just go to the gear and 'deleted account'. You can then start over with a phone number.

About

Hi, my name is Mitch McLaughlin. I grew up in Iowa and I reside in San Francisco.
Over a year ago, I dropped out of university. While in school, I studied computer science and finance, played Division 1 basketball, and interned at GoPro and Oracle, respectively.

Immediately after leaving school, I traveled the world for 6 months.

I am not completely sure what I will do the rest of my life. But, I’m currently focusing on all things bitcoin & crypto. Also, I enjoy building things (like this server), readingand writing, exercising, and having fun.

**Paradoxs 05/31/2017**

Paradox of talent - the more talent that exists, the greater the outcome relies on luck.

Automation Paradox - as computer do work, the need for humans often increase

Fermi Paradox - If there are, as various arguments suggest, many other sentient species in the Universe, then where are they? Shouldn't their presence be obvious?

kafkaesque — unnecessary complicated and frustrating experiences (bureaucracy)

Drake Equation, which estimates the number of civilizations in our Galaxy whose signals we might be able to detect—potentially thousands

Murphy's Law - what can go wrong, will go wrong eventually

Gaian Bottleneck

Paradox of Information — more information is leading us to more irrational decisions

Gambler's fallacy - So, a roulette player watches as 7 black numbers come up in a row, so he puts all of his money on red. This well-known psychological process is called the gambler’s fallacy and is the mistaken belief that if an event happens repeatedly, a different event is imminent. In reality, the odds of any particular event occurring are always the same.


Moravec's paradox is the discovery by artificial intelligence and robotics researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, high-level reasoning requires very little computation, but low-level sensorimotor skills require enormous computational resources.

Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox Can far away events influence each other in quantum mechanics?

Faraday paradox An apparent violation of Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.

Blub Paradox - Cognitive lock of some experienced programmers that prevents them from properly evaluating the quality of programming languages which they do not know.

Paradox of luck - the more skill used, the greater the outcome relies on luck.

Abilene Paradox - People can make decisions based not on what they actually want to do, but on what they think that other people want to do, with the result that everybody decides to do something that nobody really wants to do, but only what they thought that everybody else wanted to do.

Peto's paradox Humans get cancer with high frequency, while larger mammals, like whales, do not. If cancer is essentially a negative outcome lottery at the cell level, and larger organisms have more cells, and thus more potentially cancerous cell divisions, one would expect larger organisms to be more predisposed to cancer.

Paradox of Plenty The Paradox of Plenty (resource curse) refers to the paradox that countries and regions with an abundance of natural resources, specifically point-source non-renewable resources like minerals and fuels, tend to have less economic growth and worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources.

Prisoners Dilemma - two prisoners might not cooperate even though it is in there best interest to do so.

Heuristics - mental shortcut/intuitive judgements

Ubiquitous - pervasive

Basketball: The Sport That Refuses To Die

If there is one team sport that survives the next 10,000 years, to me, it's basketball. Basketball is biologically pure, in a way that artificial technology will never be able to radically change.

How Naismith Created The Game of Basketball

Why Basketball Is More Than A Sport

Dedicated to the entire basketball community and to Dr. James Naismith,

Basketball is one of the most beautiful real-world team games ever invented and it's played at the intersection of culture, biology, technology, social science, psychology, politics and economics.

Basketball was created barely over 100 years ago. It's popularity has exploded, and it's probably the fastest growing sport ever created. For comparison, soccer was created over 2000 years ago.

When I started playing basketball as a young kid, I just played because my friends did it. Now, the game feels like one of the most uniquely intricate things played by some of the world’s highest-performing humans.

-picture of me playing at a young age

-the history of basketball

A game can be defined as, <i>“a form of play or sport, especially a competitive one played according to rules and decided by skill, strength, or luck.”<i>

The Canadian-born and United States immigrant, Dr. James Naismith invented the non-violent game of basketball in 1891. Other notable inventions in that decade included the internal combustion engine, automobiles, early airplanes, motion pictures, and remote controls. During that time, the Second Industrial Revolution was also well-underway. The telegraph, radio, railroad networks, gas and water supply, steam power, use of petroleum, use of machinery and manufacturing, and sewage systems were greatly expanded. During that same period, you might have crossed paths with influential people like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Ghandi, John D. Rockefeller, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, Andrew Carnegie, Florence Nightingale, Frederick Douglass, Oscar Wilde, H.G. Wells, Frank Lloyd Wright, James Joyce, Picasso, Mark Twain, Sigmund Freud, or Monet.

James Naismith was well-rounded, physically fit, voraciously intelligent, and a humble human-being. A student of his own body and mind, he experimented with many sports from a young age including: football, rugby, lacrosse, gymnastics, ice hockey, skating, and tobogganing. He would go on to graduate top 10 in his class with a degree in Philosophy and Hebrew from McGill University and eventually, earn his medical doctorate degree at Kansas University.

He combined his interest in spirituality and physical development to create the game of basketball. He differentiated the game of basketball from other sports by emphasizing skill, or finesse, as the most important feature rather than pure force. 

On a cold December day in 1891, the light-hearted optimist at 30 year-young walked into the YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts and among a handful of troubled youths and his supervisor, Luther Gulick, proceeded to climb a mini-ladder and nail 2 empty peach baskets 15 inches in diameter, 10 feet above the floor. They were located at opposite ends of the gymnasium each on the lower-side of the balcony. Shortly thereafter, his students would participate in the first game of basket-ball.

[picture of first game]?

http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/sports-and-games/sports-biographies/james-naismith

Basketball’s original rules were particularly designed to prevent and deter violence. Recent tragedies, like the ‘Malice at the Palace’ (pictured below) were not likely to be foreseen or approved of by Dr. James Naismith. Nonetheless, these types of events are exceedingly rare while the essence of the game remains mostly non-violent. Fouling violations also remain central to how the game is conducted. As Naismith originally described in 1 of the original 13 rules of basketball,

“No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.”

It turns out, 3 of the original 13 rules were explicitly written to deter fouling.

Another defining characteristic of the game of basketball is it's accessibility. It's made possible by requiring minimal equipment and the use of a multi-purpose, relatively compact playing surface. It can be played inside or out. The average court size is 84 by 50 feet (26 by 15 meters). It requires any round-ball with a circumference of roughly 30 inches (76 centimeters) and weighs roughly 20 ounces (0.5 kilograms). In the early days, the hoop was occasionally built using only a bucket and a standalone pole.

3 years before Dr. James Naismith’s death, at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, basketball was recognized as an official sport. Some believed Dr. Naismith’s net worth at the time of his death in 1939 was around $100 million. In typical Naismith fashion, he personally refrained from boasting about it.


Basketball as a social science

“Teams can become more than just a collection of people when a strong sense of mutual commitment creates synergy, thus generating performance greater than the sum of the performance of its individual members.”

If you’ve ever wondered why the game of basketball is fulfilling to players, many might cite something similar to the quote above. You can always spot a special team when you see one. Their execution is mechanical. They conduct everything from team meals to pre-game warmups rhythmically. It's orchestrated and systematic. The nuanced beauty and sophistication of their performance can leave observers amazed. The gossip surrounding their play might even be attributed to a divine power. If you can personally recall losing to such a team, it may have felt as if losing was inevitable. This type of teams attention to detail, effort, and preparation is astounding. They can influence you into weakness and hopelessness. Metaphorically, they can reach deep into your soul, crush it, and derive pleasure from it. “What the fuck just happened?” you might utter while recalibrating your mental state.

What's less clear is how these caliber of teams take shape. Many eat team meals together, watch film, practice, do community service, attend chapel, and go on team retreats. A likely catalyst for team-building is when members share intimate details about their personal lives. For example, how it felt to grow up with no real family. Or how it felt when their father died. Or what it's like growing up mentally disabled. Or what it was like growing up addicted to drugs. Athletes can be incredibly complex, neurotic, and broken. Often they are not, but they are humans. When teammates disclose these uniquely human vulnerabilities it often solidifies mutual cooperation, trust, commitment, sacrifice, and reciprocity. This leads to a deep interconnectedness between players, coaches, and community. This is foundational to what's referred to as a ‘winning culture’.

Intentionally or not, every team develops a culture. Examples of a great culture might include never leaving the gym without completing a workout and going beyond what was initially asked. Or cleaning-up dirty laundry, food crumbs after meals, taking care of ill teammates, fixing broken lockers, moping the floor after practice, or making friends with the disabled because it's the right thing to do. Some say, “Those are not direct inputs for determining the outcome of games.” And I would agree. Doing your laundry does not actually put points on the scoreboard. However, it misses the point. The point is viewing the game of basketball, or more broadly life, idealistically. Working together toward ideals has proven to be far more effective in team success. Being idealistic is by definition unachievable and somewhat irrational. But in this case, I’d argue chasing crazy is the best strategy.

, some might say. “You will never be undefeated.” But, I’d disagree. It’s actually a more board, and deeply logical approach to producing greatness. At the individual level, it fosters an intellectually fit and discipline mind. This approach is philosophical in nature.

I don’t believe the mentioned examples in the preceding paragraphs are unexpected. But, these are exactly the atomic mechanics of human cooperation to transcend individual performance. It's social science.

Social science also deals with individuality. Individuality is art. And art is at it's core a social activity. The best basketball players, knowingly or not, are artists. They play the game to display their skill and imagination. Their style is imitated and remixed amongst the entire basketball community. Sometimes playing style cannot be ordinarily explained or measured. Why would a player celebrate in that manner? Why is that player dancing? How did a player do that move? Why does that player do that before every game? What is that player wearing? Why do the players get excited from a dunk? A player’s identity and style is an expression of the totality of relationships and learnings from their life. 

It's all a form of expression. It's art.

That is, games allow us to avoid boredom.

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/History_of_sport

The history of sports may[original research?] extend as far back as the beginnings of military training, with competition used as a means to determine whether individuals were fit and useful for service. Team sports may have developed to train and to prove the capability to fight and work together as a team (army). The history of sport can teach us about social changes and about the nature of sportitself,[citation needed] as sport seems[original research?] involved in the development of basic human skills. Of course, as one goes further back in history, dwindling evidence makes theories of the origins and purposes of sport more and more difficult to support.

basketball as psychology

“90% of this game is mental, the other half is physical.” - Yogi Berra

-player talking to himself

-interactions between players and coaches

-interactions between players and parents

To be honest, a large part of the athletic mental approach is also machine-like. Athletes don't exactly experience the world in the same way as the average person.

Basketball as a biological science

-body, mind, and nutrition

Sports are the pinnacle of biological science. Athletes operate at the highest-level of physical performance. From a very young age, athletes and their teachers plant fundamental biological seeds that transform skilled amateurs into sophisticated, highly coordinated biological machines.

Basketball as political science



Basketball as economics

Money follows the game of basketball. Professional players and coaches are signing enormous contracts while turnover rates continue to increase. Athletes at the collegiate level are monetized. Every aspect of the game is about performance. At the highest-levels, the game has become business-like.

“Moving On From Basketball”

https://www.theplayerstribune.com/paul-pierce-one-final-season/

“The death of something we intensely love is a death within ourselves. When something we love dies, part of us dies with it. Hence the suffering. Such is the suffering a parent experiences at the death of a child. The most painful of all experiences is personal death. The second most painful experience is the death of someone else.”

For some time, I have had the desire to reflect on basketball. It's important I do it while my playing experiences are still fresh. I consider in retirement of my competitive career. Although I will play basketball recreationally for a good remainder of my life, my competitive playing career is selectively finished.

A lot of people over the years have asked me about my basketball career. Most of the time, my answer consisted of one sentence. I was too lazy keep repeating myself and elaborating on the entire story. Just like any other high-stake and intricate experiment, the initial results often don’t make sense. I am going to attempt to explain to the best of my ability why I think I underachieved. But, I want you to know, even now I have a hard time myself discerning how, why, and what went wrong. I thought had all the right ingredients, but things never quite turned out. It was messy. It was complex. I always wanted to write this post because I wanted to give myself closure.                          

people a complete, frank, and transparent answer.

In any other solar system, shooting a ball through a hoop 18-inches in diameter and 10-feet high mounted to a backboard would seem strange.


I underachieved in my basketball career. I can take some responsibility for it, but in many ways severe injuries sent me down a path I could not recover from. My second year at Drake, I completely tore the outer ligament of my thumb on my shooting hand. I was in a cast for 10 weeks. I was devastated. One of the lesser talked about issues in athletics is the side-effects following a serious injury. For many athletes it can be a very dark and lonely time period. For some, it's debilitating. In the most extreme psychological cases, it can end careers.

If muscles are *mildly* active the human body recovers quickly to peak performance. The body feels fresh and rustiness disappates quickly. But, if you ask anyone who has torn a major ligament or broke a bone, it's likely they will tell you they had to start all over reteaching the injured part how to work. The plasticity with which the human body learns and unlearns movements is both incredible and terrifying, just like technology.

A guard in basketball is the David of David vs. Goliath. If David is operating at peak performance and leveraging technology, he is super effective. More so than brute stength (Goliath). However, when David is impaired physically or not fully utilizing his intellect he often gets completely dominated.

In basketball, your user interface is your legs, arms, hands, and body. But, I injured my shooting hand severely twice (once at Drake, and once at Elmhurst, both in preseason). An injury is the equivalent of your iPhone’s touch screen not responding. How was I suppose to compete without the full-functionality of my device?

————

http://www.axonpotential.com/athletes-and-age-of-peak-performance/

The consistency of this rise-peak-decline pattern is striking, even across very different sports. For nearly every major sport, the age of peak performance is in the range of 22-30, and some interesting trends emerge when you look at sport type in relation to an athlete’s peak age. The age at which performance tends to peak across sports seems to mirror the continuum from purely explosive, athletic sports to slower, more skill-based sports, with explosive sports peaking earlier. Further, even within sports that combine different abilities, explosive abilities (e.g. base stealing in baseball) tend to peak earlier than more cognitive, skill-based abilities (e.g. drawing walks in baseball).
* For baseball, a number of studies, using different methods, have pegged peak age between 27-29. (Link) * For Tennis, peak age has been pegged between the early 20′s and 25. (Link) * For basketball, peak age has been found to be at 27 for all positions, with different positions showing different patterns of decline. (Link) * For Track and Field, peak sprinting age has been found to be in the lower-mid twenties, with endurance events having older peak ages. (Link) * For golf, athletes have broader peaks–between 25-35, with slower declines. (Link) * For football, running backs and receivers peak around 27, with running backs showing sharper fall-offs than receivers. Quarterbacks have a broader peak between 25-35. (Link)

Agassi’s knowing laugh echoes his belief that “you can’t spread who you are without being broken first. Sometimes, when you’ve been broken into pieces, you come back and give much more to people. You can see my scars and they’re key to me making a difference in other lives now. You can’t have any wounds in this game that don’t leave scars. They never quite heal but they make you who you are.”

Moving On

Surely he misses the intensity? “I miss that the least. That was always the tough part for me. I enjoyed the work that went into making yourself the best you can be but I hated what the scoreboard doesn’t say. It just tells you if you won or lost. But the biggest issue for most athletes is you spend a third of your life not preparing for the next two-thirds. One day your entire way of life comes to an end. It’s a kind of death. You just have to go through it and figure it out. In her own quiet way Steffi feels stronger than me. She’s pretty linear in how she lives. I probably do a little more reminiscing than she does – which says a lot.”

Over reliance on talent:

But he has so much athleticism he has a tendency to rely on that and make matches harder than they need to be.

———

The game also changed the way people view the world. Some people and kids love basketball so much, they devote their lives to the game. Basketball is everything to some people, like me. Also, many kids are trying harder in school to keep their grades up so they can play sports like basketball. Professional athletes talk to schools about kids dropping out of school.  They tell them it's not the right thing to do and that they need to stay in school so when they get older they can get a good job. Many kids set high goals for themselves to achieve, like being the best basketball player. For some, the sport is more than a game, it's a passion (Dr. James Naismith-The inventor of Basketball). This is why basketball changes the way people think about everything.

10. Today, some 400 million people worldwide play basketball, making it the second-most popular sport in the world, according to the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).

What my project is: An open-source software protocol, a purely-functional programmable blockchain.

Why I am doing it: 

I think we all wake up everyday and want to do our part in making the world a better place. My project just happens to be the next launching point in a vision I have carefully refined through worldly experiences my 24 years of life. A vision that fundamentally is built on serving others. My project also happens to be at a stage where the window of opportunity for financial support aligns nicely. Finances aside, I would like you to feel personally welcome and connected to all the highs and lows a successful project can have.

Before I introduce the project, I think it's important to explain my world view. I’d prefer to omit or postpone discussion of my accomplishments because they could be overshadowed by my values and what I stand for. 

I have been very lucky so far in my life. For quite some time, I have been at peace and appreciative of whatever the remaining days of my life will bring. I do not feel like I have anything to prove to anybody, although I remain highly-motivated. I am not inspired by revenge or hatred or money or any shifty notion of success. The only metric I derive my self-worth from is how much joy, opportunity, fairness, and love I am able to bring to others. And that leads me to this project.

Software is one way nerds are able to express utopian world views in a virtual environment. A creation can be as perfect as it's creator forges it to be. And it can convey meaning in a way that is unconventional, transcendent, and enduring. That is the connection I feel to my project.

My project is an open-source software protocol. It lives in the Bitcoin/crypto world. It arose from a few years of research and from observing the shortcomings and philosophical differences with the current state of cryptocurrency protocols. It's a highly-flexible and purely-functional programmable blockchain.

A purely-functional programmable blockchain assumes a few unprecedented shifts in the history of software and more broadly the world.

An estimated timeline(roughly):

————

I am applying as a individual developer. I don't think my project falls under any of the listed categories, but broadly, it’s a open-source software protocol.

Tagline: An open-source software protocol, “a purely-functional programmable blockchain.” 

I think we all wake up everyday and want to do our part in making the world a better place. My project just happens to be the next launching point in a vision I have carefully refined through worldly experiences in my 24 years of life. A vision that fundamentally is built on serving others. My project also happens to be at a stage where the window of opportunity for financial support aligns nicely. Finances aside, I want Segment to feel welcome and connected to all the highs and lows a successful project can have.

Before I introduce the project, I think it's important to explain my world view. I have been very lucky so far in my life. For quite some time, I have been at peace and appreciative of whatever the remaining days of my life will bring. I do not feel like I have anything to prove to anybody, although I remain highly-motivated. I am not inspired by revenge or hatred or money or any shifty notion of success. The only metric I derive my self-worth from is how much joy, opportunity, fairness, and love I am able to bring to others. And that leads me to this project.

Software is one way nerds are able to express utopian world views in a virtual environment. A creation can be as perfect as it's creator forges it to be. And it can convey meaning in a way that is unconventional, transcendent, and enduring. That is the connection I feel to my project.

My project is an open-source software protocol. It lives in the Bitcoin/crypto world. It arose from a few years of research and from observing the shortcomings and philosophical differences with the current state of cryptocurrency protocols. It's a highly-flexible and purely-functional programmable blockchain.

A purely-functional programmable blockchain assumes a few unprecedented shifts in the history of software and more broadly the world. It assumes the future of democracy is a layer on top of the internet and is manifested through software. It assumes peer-to-peer networking software can provide opportunities to global citizens who are marginalized by top-down controlled institutions. It assumes financial outcomes in software can be positive-sum. It assumes culture and politics is on the verge of becoming increasingly unstable. These are just a few of the empirical observations that pushed me into the Bitcoin/crypto space.

The technical ingredients of a purely-functional programmable blockchain are fairly straightforward. It leverages functional programming characteristics with regards to how it handles algorithms and data. I have not finished thinking through all the technical details, but the tech will be written in a Lisp-style language. Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on OOP (object-oriented) principles. This predisposes their technology to be more suitable for applications requiring medium-to-high data rigidity. But, a functional blockchain is fundamentally a more elegant and a differentiated approach for applications requiring secure, highly mutable data structures.

When I entered the crypto space I had no idea where I would end up. But, all I knew was I wanted to pursue the most ambitious path I could find. That is this project. I kindly ask you to consider it.

Follow-up Q&A

I think I answered the why questions in the essay. But, I will add a few specific responses.

Q: What is this project doing for people?

A: Makes the best finance and political platform accessible to all global citizens. Provides state-of-the-art tools for the top software developers to build apps.

Q: Does it create a lot of value for a few people or some value for a lot of people?

A: Both. It will bring opportunities to the masses and provides great value to a select group of talented developers.

Q: How does our grant help enable progress?

A: It will serve as a bridge until the project is publicly launched.

Q: Are you working on it?

A: Yes.

Q: What do you see as success working on this project?

A: Success is very simply the continued development of the protocol, the tools, and the community.

Q: What is the current state of the project?

A: Research and writing of the technical white paper.

Q: What do you think you’ll be able to accomplish during the program?

A: My estimated timeline for deliverables (roughly):

3-4 months out (by end of July): A completed technical white paper. And I will begin looking/adding technical contributors to the project if I have not already done so.

4-10 months out: A fully tested, production ready v1.0 launch/release. A publicly-available initial coin offering to offer shares in the growth of the protocol. It can serve as continued funding.

12+ months out: Continue testing and implementing new features, preparing to scale the network, and continued growth of the community.

What worries Pentagon planners most is that the Russians appear to be looking for vulnerabilities at much greater depths, where the cables are hard to monitor and breaks are hard to find and repair.

The end of money. /self expression/Experience(s) are(is) the blood that flows thru our economy.

Happiness is not always intentional. Experiences are not always intentional. Creation is not always intentional.

What is money?

What is the economy?

capitalism/Money is a great enabler of technology. Mixes art & science.

What happens when we think ourselves out of the economic systems? We have become so efficient, profits are zero.

If profits are zero,

Current system ... People technology capital output ROI

Future people tech/tools output entirely psychological rewards.

What would it mean to have power if money isn't the metric/indicator? How do you measure psychological power? Peace of mind? Power of mind?

Bell curve of fulfillment.

More people getting more fulfilled overall then any other time in history.

Quality of life? Not just measured by income. Will be measured by psychological fulfillment.

Psychological formula = sacrifice, discipline, mental energy output comraderie fulfillment accomplishment

The barrier to global impact (creation) is being reduced. The formula for creation is becoming simpler. Work/focus people tech/tools

3 billion ppl. A fraction of that pool now has access to creation. Even if it's a small fraction, the results/output will result in exponential gains.

Humans will always be tool makers. Humans are enablers?

The experience economy. Transcended good & services. Paying for experiences. Experience vs service.

The beginning of the end of 'money' as we know it has arrived. These bills we use, metal we exchange, and the different currencies will be meaningless. 

We are all going to have no money. The world will run on happiness & fulfillment.

All we are doing is trading experiences, and everyone else will soon be too.

The strange thing is life had never been about money, it's always been about happiness and experiences. Because we have been deceived. Happiness is simple it appears "too easy to be true" meanwhile money appears too make things easier but it adds complex it because of too many options.

Here's why having no money is actually a good thing. Money is just a store of value, however nothing forbids a persons characteristics as being a store of value. Imagine this scenario, Fred is the wealthiest/most successful person in the world he has accumulated 6 doodads (insert creativity metric here) of creativity! Amazing! The rest of the world has only accumulated 0.1 doodads combined. And as the world gets more individualized, our personality traits may become to the new 'currency'.

How did we measure wealth before money?

Today, money allows people to do many things, exchange goods and services, gamble, invest, buy time/convince, donate to charity, and impact the works in many awesome ways.

Let's examine the richest people in the world & what they do with their money & why they spend it the way they do.

Gates buffet zuck etc

Money is just a tool for them to do much bigger things. To make changes in the world. Money controls the political process PACs. They don't actually care about money. Money doesn't provide them happiness. Helping others does. Giving others opportunities does. Not because they need to see others succeed but more simply because it's the right thing to do. Morality is the driver of these elites ambitions.

One day a consesious will be reached where money has no value, intrinsically or psychologically. It's entirely possible that the new measure of success/power/wealth will become creativity. Creativity or simply connecting dots will be the only value.

How done measure wealth today? Wealth can mean many things but when it comes to money one of the best metrics or indicators may very well be the Forbes list. One could argue these are worlds most powerful people. When we transcend the world of money, it begs the question.

How will we measure creativity in this future civilization? It's really tough today to measure creativity. If you talk to intelligent people the best indicator they suggest is "follow your intuition". Well that couldn't be more ambiguous. But in tomorrow's world we will demand new metrics to measure an individual's creativity.

"Follow your passion" "don't follow your passion" how about do what makes you happy. And who gives a fuck about how much money we make.

AI if the network of all human brains are working together and activated, vs all of the machine intelligent

Our data will be the blood that powers the Artificial Intelligence.

when we first thought about artificial intelligence & the singularity we feared machine intelligence would transcend human intelligence (see Elon Musk & Bill Gate posts here, document to warn of superhuman AI). however, we didn’t acknowledge that human brains operate as a network NOT isolation. If you can imagine, we zoom out from one individual’s brain and take a look collectively at ALL human brains we see a much more powerful network of human intelligence at work. There’s good and bad news. The bad news is, if humanity is negligent we could be outcompeted(via natural selection) by a network of machine intelligence and it could spell the end of the human race. The good news is today, 9-22-2015, we control our destiny because generations & generations before us have crafted a foundation of intelligence that has given us an advantage. And we must work hard to get the remaining world’s brains online and contributing to our world’s intelligence, I am optimistic the world’s collective human brain can and will out compete the network of machine intelligence. Furthermore, I’m willing to bet if we believe in hard work, faith, the good of humanity, karma, or whatever it is, we can will prevail.

The weird thing about this new world that may come about is the fact that humans and machines will coexist enduring constant stress & anxiety over competitive pressures. The world is getting increasingly competitive. We may be on the verge of a new Cold War against machines.

our characters lie on a continuum and things change. this is why we sympathize with those who currently reside on the wrong side of the continuum. https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/05/11/out-of-character/

What the Nazi generals taught me about human nature.

I sat in the Topography of Terror Museum, once the residence of Himlivk Himler, the SS (Nazi Police), the Gustapo(), and all those leaders who negligently participated in genocide. I felt at peace in their presence. Just as I am attuned with my own sins. We must all embrace the darkness in our hearts and prevail with the power of good. Don't let the evils overcome.

I could hear Himlick Homler speaking to me, "I am sorry, I did so many bad things to so many people, including endangering my family. If I had to do it over again, I would do everything different."

And we whispered, "it's ok, we forgive you."

The miracle of your mind is that you can see the world as it isn't. We can imagine the future, we can remember the past.

The miracle of your mind is that you can see the world as it isn't. We can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place.

We need to think big, we need to think cheap, we need to think about the problem differently.

We owe it to our children & grandchildren.

We can't just bomb our way out, were gunna invent our way out, working together.

We have the tools, we have the passion; we can be more, we can be much more.

We have 3 billion new minds coming online, to do that which we must do.

A Gift. The most special gifts I ever received weren't given to me because someone "had to" or because it was Christmas. The gifts themselves were just thoughtful. This doesn't mean gifts can't be special on holidays, anniversaries, or the like. But, it does mean
Great gifts are not a function of the calendar day rather it is how much thought was invested.

When you give a gift it becomes a symbol for a shared secret between 2 people.

Almost always you have a preexisting relationship with the person you gave the gift to. So what's really happening is the gift symbolizes all of the experiences, or more broadly the happiness enjoyed in the relationship. Maybe is why sentimental gifts are the best. Because it's not about how much it costs, or how materially pleasing it is, rather how unique it is.

Instead of thinking about applying to 'a job' try to think about applying to 'an area of jobs'. What this means is your skills are likely to have crossover into adjacent positions. Reason is, many companies will reach when hiring interns if they believe your motivation to learn outweigh your compatibility with the desired job requirements. This is true because interns have time or room for growth. It's important to note the farther in your career your are the harder it is to get a company to 'reach' on you. Although not impossible. So use your youth as an advantage.

Collective intelligence is all we have. Decentralized decision making.

Open sourcing isn't about making money. It's about survival. We're protecting our race from whatever species arises.

If our grandchildren are to have a better life, we have to survive amidst AI.

Transparency. Our future relies on transparency.

Forget talking about empathy, consciousness, ...

A strong AI's perceptions are beyond human understanding.

It is not life, it's technology. The robot doesn't have to give a shit about you.

A Reminder To Myself About Having Fun

--- Having fun is underrated.

The saddest thing I see is having the option and passing up fun experiences in life. Life is too short, we take life so seriously and 

I'm not sure why. Maybe its human nature to pity ourseleves. Its easy, its a trap.

 The feeling when him experience a moment or laughter with friends of getting lost on the moment. Nothing can match that, no amount or money can compensate for that. This is why a friendship always trumps money. Laughter is scientifically a stress relief. Happiness is a very fragile item and you have to protect it, feed it, and foster its growth. I've witness some or my best friends walking the thin line between happiness and depression. Some fell down the slippery slope of chronic unhappiness after a few critical things didn't go their way. By no means was it their fault. Sometimes you just get dealt a terrible hand. I lost a good friend and close teammate of mine Conlon White at a young age. I struggled for a long time on how to handle it and how to move on. I think writing these words is helping me cope with his loss which I can not ever forget. An innocent life gone. I miss you Conlon.

As with the seed of life happiness is more fragile when we are younger. Its naturally immature and weak. If I had go bet id say suicide rates among those under 21 is higher than those over 21 for this reason.

When you are feeling sad you have go train ourselves to recognize it. Take a day off, feed your soul, have some fun.

Too much fun can similiarly be dangerous. When all you do is fun, its not fleeting anymore, its yihr life. Its value is diluted because its no longer scarce. human nature allows to stop appreciating it. I vividly remember the look in a persons eyes

Finding The Right Community.

NOMADS

Shifting to the nomadic life

The reality of the changing environment is nomadic living is much more economically scalable than the current environment.

Being nomadic means independence and freedom.

Being a nomad means independence and freedom. It means continuously gaining new experiences. It means full-time education. It means making connections. It means having opportunities. It means doing self-experiments. And it’s all that, all in one. Massive, isn’t it? Yes

But I’m not even just talking about the constant state of movement when I talk about the nomadic freedom lifestyle. Above all, being a nomad is a mindset.

It’s a temporary state for those of us in a lower income demographic.

The world is already in a state of financial uncertainty and instability and the trend will continue increasing.

Recently, I’ve had an increasing amount of folks who are picking up everything & leaving their home for a different life.

Renting is basically throwing money away. Seriously. My fellow SF intern and roommate Jay Ives and I split a 1BR apartment in Nob Hill totaling $4000/mo.

Work out the numbers.

Even though renting is an economic nightmare. Owning a home is even scarier. Then you really can’t move at all.

but my time on the road showed me that more and more stateside Millennials are traveling and living abroad as well.

According to a report by Boston Consulting Group, Millennials are traveling despite our collective $322 billion in student debt. In 2010, our travel spending rose 10%, and we’re the fastest growing age segment in travel spending. But this money isn’t just going towards vacation.

Many of us are building lifestyles around location independence. We’re becoming nomadic.

Supranational borders is going to increase in significance.

So while so many of us might not be “settling down” like our parents had hoped, we’re building lifestyles that allow us to see more of the world, and collecting a greater variety of experiences by keeping our options open.

Conquering the world. (Via travel)

You would need…

Control of the money.

Control of the banks.

Control of trade.

Control of energy.

Control of the food.

Control of healthcare.

Control of medicine.

Control of education.

Control of the military.

Control of dissent.


The world is far to large. 7 billion people, 200 millions of square miles of land, and millions of interest points. Given unlimited money you could maybe do it all. The world can not be conquered. 

With the help of others, we have a slim chance to conquer 1% of the world.

If we are kind and selfless, along the journey of life we will run into some caring people, and they may help us conquer a small fraction of the world. The best case scenario for an individual is conquering 1% of the world, average case is 0.00001%, worst case around 0.0000000001%. Life is to insignificant to take serious. No one gives a shit. 99% of humanity will never care about my life or your life. That is a fact.

Some of us may have a clear and defined purpose, some of us may float. Neither of us is wrong.

I love talking to people who society considers "failures" and to me they are living their best possible life.

I'm arguing for appreciating the fragile & beautiful moments we experience everyday. The moments we expect to always be there.

The emotional moments. Hearing the voice of parents. Laughing with friends. Physical love of a companion. Crying, being alone, scared, death and helplessness. We all feel it, why would we be scared of it. It is meant to be celebrated. While we search for whatever life is supposed to be. Some feel good and some terrible. Doesn't matter, what we feel makes us alive.

We want more money, we are not happy. We want to get married, we want to be single. We want to have kids, we don't want responsibility. We want to be famous, we don't want the headaches. We want more vacation, we are not fulfilled. We want more friends, we feel more alone. We want to be nice, we want to be evil. We want to be proper, we want to be sloppy. We want to travel, we want to go home. We want chaos, we want order. People call us crazy. But that's who we are.

The Internet is really good at explaining the macro, but the micro must be experienced to understand the whole.

The best opportunities are invisible.

CHRISTMAS

The first and last Christmas without my family.

To: Mom, Dad, Brother, and my extended family. With love ❤️.

Sorry, Mom & Dad & Brother I could not be at Christmas this year. I can’t imagine how it must have felt. I’m sorry I was not able to hand you the latest & greatest gifts I planned to give you.

I’m in a unfamiliar place half way across the world. Alone, it sucks, but being in a dark place gives me a unique perspective. Stripping away the formalities of Christmas I can see the real reasons why Christmas is so special.

We are all luckily to receive gifts each year. The best gifts are exceptionally thoughtful. We tend to think of gifts as boxes under the tree which take place a given calendar day. But, gifts can be special on any day of the year & they may not have wrapping paper. It might be something we can not touch, it might be a fleeting moment with a family member, or it might be continuous and on-going experience like a relationship.

The best gifts I have are relationships. Particularly, the one I have with you. I love you all and I will especially appreciate the moments I will have with you for the rest of my life.

-Mitch

Most notably, with my parents. They are in their mid-50s. Before I left for college, I saw them almost everyday living at home (300 days a year). Now, I see them only a handful of times each year (maybe 10 days a year). I would like to be optimistic and say I’m lucky both of them are still alive. My parents and I have roughly 40 years left of coexistence, best case scenario. I could argue I have already spent 90% of the total days with my parents when I lived at home. Only 10% remains in the final 40 years.

Despite not being at the end of my life, I may very well be near the end of my time with the most important people in my life. I can draw out the total days spent with my parents, it becomes even more clear.

It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.

It’s a similar story with my two sisters. After living in a house with them for 10 and 13 years respectively, I now live across the country from both of them and spend maybe 15 days with each of them a year. Hopefully, that leaves us with about 15% of our total hangout time left.

The same often goes for old friends. In high school, I sat around playing hearts with the same four guys about five days a week. In four years, we probably racked up 700 group hangouts. Now, scattered around the country with totally different lives and schedules, the five of us are in the same room at the same time probably 10 days each decade. The group is in its final 7%.

So what do we do with this information?

Setting aside my secret hope that technological advances will let me live to 700, I see three takeaways here:

1) Living in the same place as the people you love matters. I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else.

2) Priorities matter. Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you—not by unconscious inertia.

3) Quality time matters. If you’re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you’re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious.

QUANTUM Mechanics

Algorithms implemented in quantum might be completely different from software today.

To develop on a quantum computer, you have to really understand hardware.

“Most important science”

-scale (atomic/universal)

-purity (perfect/imperfect)

-abstractness (foundational/philosophical)

-psychologically (simplicity/complexity)

-relativity

-connectedness (interwoven/isolated)

“Computational problems”

-decision problems (each instance has yes/no)

-search (collection of instance pairs)

-counting (number of pairs in a given search problem)

-optimization (finding a "best possible" solution among the set of all possible solutions to a search problem)

-function ("Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each 
city exactly once and returns to the origin city.) — Traveling Saleman Problem

"is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means, but we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth"

Someone recently said "you read so slow!". I started to wonder, does reading slower correlate to intelligence?

"i have an idea!"

Do not ever forget empathy you had. People are fucking suffering. Help them. Just because someone made one bad trajectory decision does not mean then deserve to suffer. We are human.

I would not be surprised if the theory of everything, complete AI, and the algorithm of life are recursive.


the trouble with secrecy isn't  participation
denies to the government the wisdom & resources of the whole country

anyone should say what they think, synopsis, mediation

let men argue, support, deny, etc.

free and uncorrupted communication

heart of a technological world, freedom

why does everything have to be secret?

we are all aware of the dangers…

secrets about thoughts & intentions of men (because some thoughts are dark)

History the Web

OpenVPN

OpenVPN uses the underlying cryptographic mechanism of SSL/TLS to secure a VPN connection, but the web analogy stops there. OpenVPN can best be understood as a portable, user-space VPN implementation which uses SSL/TLS as its underlying cryptographic engine. 

OpenVPN is able to use the same public key infrastructure as Apache, but is otherwise not related to the secure web.

GREAT QUESTIONS: How do we minimize the amount of manual configuration required? How do we streamline the key management process? I would argue that it would be premature to codify the user-space VPN model into a standard until we have a better handle on the usability and management issues.

Advanced BASH http://samrowe.com/wordpress/advancing-in-the-bash-shell/

Circumflex hats

Have you ever typed a command, hit return and a micro-second later realized that you made a typo? Back when I still used the more pager I was always typing:

$ mroe filename 

Luckily, the folks who wrote bash weren’t the greatest typists either. In bash, you can fix typos in the previous command with a circumflex (^) or "hat." Consider the following:

$ vi /etc/Somefile.conf #(oops!)

$ ^f^F

Which bash turns into:

$ vi /etc/SomeFile.conf

tab-tab

One of my favorite features of bash is tab-completion. Tab-completion works in a couple of ways, it can complete filenames in the current directory or in your $PATH. Like the !commandsabove, you just need to give bash enough of the filename to make it unique and hit the tab key — bash will do the rest for you. Let’s say you have a file in your home directory called ransom.note, consider the following:

$ mor[tab] ran[tab]

Will expand to

$ more ransom.note

Let’s say you also have a file named random in your home directory. ran above is no longer enough to be unique, but you’re in luck. If you hit tab twice, bash will print the list of matching files to the screen so that you can see what you need to add to make your shortcut unique.

Brace Expansion

Everyone has done one of the following to make a quick backup of a file:

$ cp filename filename-old

$ cp filename-old filename 

These seem fairly straightforward, what could possibly make them more efficient? Let’s look at an example:

$ cp filename{,-old}

$ cp filename{-old,}

$ cp filename{-v1,-v2} 

In the first two examples, I’m doing exactly the same thing as I did in the previous set of examples, but with far less typing. The first example takes a file named filename and copies it tofilename-old The second example takes a file named filename-old and copies it to simplyfilename.

Aliases

Using aliases is sort of like creating your own commands. You decide what you want to type andwhat happens when you type that. Aliases can live in a few of different places, ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile ~/.profile and ~/.aliases are some, but not all. In fact, you’re not really limited to keeping them all in one place. Those different files behave differently based upon what kind of shell you’re running, but that’s beyond the scope of this document. For the purposes of this discussion, we’ll settle on ~/.bash_profile (used for login shells.)

In that file, usually at the bottom, I assemble my aliases. Here’s some examples:

alias ud=’aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade’

alias ls=’ls –color=auto’

alias mroe=’less’

alias H=’kill -HUP’

alias ssh=’ssh -AX’

alias webshare=’python -c “import SimpleHTTPServer;SimpleHTTPServer.test()”‘

The bottom one will probably wrap, but it provides a great example of why aliases are great. A whole string of commands has been reduced to something short and easy to remember.

**Android Bill of Rights 01/03/2017**

If you believe, like I do, androids may evolve into a species of there-own, it’s worthwhile to begin formulating what their rights may look like.

Related: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/a_robotic_bill.html

Android Bill of Rights by Mitchell McLaughlin

Amendment 1 — The legislative body shall make no law respecting a belief system or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of electronic communication or of the broadcasting of information, or to the right of the androids peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a recess of grievances.

Amendment 2 — A well-regulated android militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the androids to keep and bear moderate electronic weapons shall not be infringed.

Amendment 3 — No android soldier shall, in time of peace, be quarter in any private house without the consent of the owner, not in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law.

Amendment 4 — The right of the androids to be secure in their environment, material possessions, private information, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the androids or things to be seized.

Amendment 5 — No android shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or android militia, when actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any android be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.

Amendment 6 — In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury (human and android) of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witness against the machine; to have compulsory process for obtaining witness in the machine’s favor; and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.

Amendment 7 — In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States than according to the rules of the common law.

Amendment 8 — Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.

Amendment 9 — The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the androids.

Amendment 10 — The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the androids. 

Key Questions

**How liberal should we be with basic rights for androids?

**What are android’s birthrights?

**Should android’s basic rights even be structured in an amendment format?

08/06/2015 - screenshots of my laptop set up to import derek’s ether wallet 

“wallet is locked with a passphrase”

Derek advises me to keep the ether in the presale wallet, because it has better security (can not be victim to hacking, if an exchange company were to get hacked)

08/08/2015 - hang out at dereks

payment to be made in 2 lumps ($3k daily withdrawal limits for wells fargo): $3k + $3.614k (ether + uber)

later that day Derek texts “I think I need to unwind a bit”

08/18/2016 - Mitch texts “we might have to try that ether password recovery soon and try to sell them all”

09/21/2016 - Mitch texts “in the ethereum password, there was no symbols any guess what you might have used?” Derek responds: “# or !”

10/06/2016: Mitch emails dave bitcoin (wallet recovery services) to get status of recovery

Dave Bitcoin shares this link of the transaction history.

https://etherchain.org/account/0x6b83bae7b565244558555bcf4ba8da2011891c17

**Best Man Speech 09/04/2016**

I feel extremely thankful to be here today amongst the families and friends of the bride and the groom.

Matt has told me he loves me many times, but I actually don’t care. The truth is, hanging out with him and seeing him with Kristen is more rewarding. So, I am really happy to be here for this celebration.

I want to share one memory from the past and one looking ahead. Only two memories.

The first memory is about the day I got beat up in our neighboorhood as a child. I mouthed off to an older kid, who lived in a nearby house, and he proceeded to punch and kick me me in the face. I will never forget coming home. My family noticed something was very wrong. My face bruised and battered. I looked over at Matt and he looked especially angry. I remember him saying something like, “I am going to beat that kids ass.” Great, I thought. 

Love is an obscure concept, especially at that age. But, I felt something and it changed me. Matt you may not remember this. And, I think like many times you personally never know how your actions have a profound impact. But, I have modeled my idea of love around this instance when you stood up for me. I was just laying there, broken physically and mentally, and you lifted me up. You could never premeditate a response like that. So thank you.

My second memory is the day I found out Matt and Kristen were getting married. I was in my apartment in Elmhurst, IL, outside of Chicago. Matt called, and said, “Kristen and I are getting engaged.” Wow…

I sat in my room and cried for hours and then days. My initial reaction was my best buddy was slipping away and there was nothing I could do. I have experienced some mildly hard situations in my life. But, it doesn't really compare to my diminishing relevance in the importance of my brother. Kristen gained relevance, and I lost it. I’m very selfish. I wanted Matt all to myself. I never wanted to share him, I thought.

I admit, I have a lot of brotherly blind spots. I can't be everything for Matt. Kristen has provided the clean perspective I never could. I am jealous of that. I am jealous that she can touch his heart and change him for the better where I cannot. I know she has that ability because she has touched my heart too.

To Matt I say protect Kristen like you protected me, when that guy beat me up. To Kristen I say, protect Matt with your love. He is yours now. You are eternally deserving. You are his everything, and that is the way it is meant to be. I cant wait to hang out with you guys for the rest of my life. I love you both so much. Thank you.





----------------

Begin with a quote about connectedness of people.




He taught me the standard for love. What a nice idea, I thought. Would not that be nice if we all treated each other with the same level of love and respect.

Matt and I have an extremely special relationship. But, I, we rarely talk about it openly. I am not sure why. Our relationship is juicy with love. Like a waterbaloon waiting to be poked.

Maybe it is all of those nintendo 

We define each other
Like fork and spoon. Same DNA, related, same chemical make up, but wildly different use cases. But at the end of the day, we're still from the same napkin.




Elmhurst story -- 

I cried. Im not sure why. Maybe it was because I was scared, afraid of the worst, happy, anxious, intimidate, or all of these.




Kristen I'm here for you. Matt I'm here for you. I got you.


We are all connected and involved in your story now. We are apart of you. And we support you unconditionally.

Best Man Speech

The Serious Side of Matt...

AEON Article... Da Vinci vs Michelangelo

When we were younger I think we were playing in the yard, wrestling, riding our bikes, eating a lot of food, and playing video games. We never thought about anything. We were just kids.

It is hard to describe what it is like sharing a pre-determined path with a brother. Sometimes our dealings were exploitative, loving, jubilation, sad, strange, and many more.



Its not about what he wants to hear its about what he needs to hear

I think he has found his identity

He is the essence of traditionakism

Im not sure why people are brought together but I think it's up to us to make it last

When you have the best its a strange illysion because it doesn't feel like the best, but you 2 are the best I can assure you.

I'm not sure what marriage means anymore but krusten is the closest thing I've seen to something perfect for matt

Like 2 bouncy balls just bouncinv around

There eccentric their a power couple

Im not really afruad for the future of these two 

Every one of us here is supporting you. We believe in you

We believe in you because you believe in you

I still do not fully comprehend marriage, is it a celebration, a spiritual endeavour, a fornality, 

At first I thought marriage means you have hit the peak never to return. Physically , etc etc

But its just not true, every new peak won't look at all like the last. But without some guts you won't find the peak.

The future lead are not forseeable or even

Reach new peaks, find new victories, 

Solitude

As you get older you always experience more solitude. Inalways thought that was sad

I think about life like a CPU 

I think about your childhood and experiences and it all makes sense. So next time you guys are mad at each kther its probably because you are really just arguing with that same inner voice. Neither of you are right, you are probably being l psychopathic

Matt Speech

Mom & Dad fighting.

Video games.

Childhood fighting.

I thought I had lost had lost him, I cried for hours. I did not know if I was mad, jealous, scared, or afraid our time was running out. This is what he said. "No, we added the best person to the team."

                   **A Cypherpunk's Manifesto 08/17/2016**

                        **by Eric Hughes**

Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
Privacy is not secrecy.  A private matter is something one doesn't
want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one
doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively
reveal oneself to the world.  

If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of
their interaction.  Each party can speak about their own memory of
this; how could anyone prevent it?  One could pass laws against it,
but the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to
an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all.  If many
parties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the
others and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other
parties.  The power of electronic communications has enabled such
group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it
to.

Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a
transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary
for that transaction.  Since any information can be spoken of, we
must ensure that we reveal as little as possible.  In most cases
personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a
store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. 
When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages,
my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying
or what others are saying to me;  my provider only need know how to
get the message there and how much I owe them in fees.  When my
identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction,
I have no privacy.  I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must
_always_ reveal myself.

Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
systems.  Until now, cash has been the primary such system.  An
anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system.  An
anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when
desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy. — “differential privacy”

Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography.  If I say
something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it.  If 
the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no
privacy.  To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to
encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
privacy.  Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when
the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.

We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless
organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.  It is to
their advantage to speak of us, and  we should expect that they will
speak.  To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the
realities of information. Information does not just want to be free,
it longs to be free.  Information expands to fill the available
storage space.  Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin;
Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and
understands less than Rumor.

We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any.  We must
come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions
to take place.  People have been defending their own privacy for
centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret
handshakes, and couriers.  The technologies of the past did not allow
for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.

We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems.  We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail
forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic
money.

Cypherpunks write code.  We know that someone has to write software
to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do,
we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow
Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all
to use, worldwide.  We don't much care if you don't approve of the
software we write.  We know that software can't be destroyed and that
a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. 

Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
fundamentally a private act.  The act of encryption, in fact, removes
information from the public realm.  Even laws against cryptography
reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with
it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible. 

For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
People must come and together deploy these systems for the common
good.  Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's
fellows in society.  We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your
concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive
ourselves.  We will not, however, be moved out of our course because
some may disagree with our goals.

The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for
privacy.  Let us proceed together apace.

Onward.

**TPW blog 07/14/2016**

how i turned down 300k

“When I’m old and dying, I plan to look back on my life and say “wow, that was an adventure,” not “wow, I sure felt safe.”

selling gravatar to automatic

“I’m not sure if you’ve ever had to work on a project while your users are publicly skewering you on your blog for allowing the service to go down, but it’s as close to depression as I’ve ever come.”

“I want to say that Twitter went through the same thing, but they suffered their downtime with millions of dollars in the bank. The only thing I had was a full time job unrelated to Gravatar and a credit card that reminded me every month of my bad judgment.”

“There seems to be a corollary to the Twitter Effect that I’d call the Forgiveness Effect. It dictates that if a user enjoys a free service and that service is currently up, all past atrocities will be easily and quickly forgiven. With the site running again, things looked to be shifting back towards a success.”

“Things always seem so clear in retrospect. But it was pride and persistence that kept me in the game long enough to have anything to look back on at all. While the line between horrible mistake and runaway success may be difficult to see, you can still find it if you look hard enough.”

how to meet your next cofounder

“Of the people that you like, several may make excellent candidates for cofounders. Do a little research on these individuals. What does their code look like? Have they done much open source? Do they demonstrate an entrepreneurial spirit? Can they stick with a single project for a long time? Have they been loyal to their friends and companies in the past? A good cofounder should be someone with whom you feel privileged to work. And they should feel privileged to work with you. The two of you should be on very solid ground before you begin your startup adventure, because once you do, the impact of every argument is going to feel like it’s been multiplied by a thousand.”

“Maybe you’re wondering if it would be better to just go solo. I did that with Gravatar, and, in retrospect, it’s painfully obvious that I made a lot of stupid mistakes. When it’s just you and your thoughts it becomes too easy to pick the first thing that pops into your head. We’re programmed to think all of our ideas are good, but reality tells a different story. Truly good decisions are forged from the furnace of argument, not plucked like daisies from the pasture of a peaceful mind. A good cofounder tells you when your ideas are half-baked and ensures that your good ideas actually get implemented.”

“The second biggest danger with going solo is the loss of motivation. Solipsism might make you feel important at first, but the constant lack of feedback and the absence of support during tough times can easily lead to a premature end to your adventure. Cofounders are like workout buddies. Just when you think there’s no possible way you can do another rep, there they are, rooting you on toward an achievement that wouldn’t be possible without them.

Your choice of cofounder will affect everything you do in your startup. They’ll share every defeat with you and celebrate every success. They’ll help you understand your own ideas better by offering a different perspective. They’ll be the single most important decision you make during the tenure of your startup, so choose wisely and with extreme care.”

blogging like a hacker

“I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and refine your thoughts about a given topic.”

“I feel a lightness now when I’m writing a post. The system is simple enough that I can keep the entire conversion process in my head. The distance from my brain to my blog has shrunk, and, in the end, I think that will make me a better author.”

git parable

“The VCS deals very well with linear development, but for the first time ever, you need to create a new snapshot that is not a direct descendent of the preceding snapshot. If you create a snapshot-110 (remember that you created 10 snapshots since the release), then you’ll be interrupting the linear flow and will have no way of determining the ancestry of any given snapshot. Clearly, you need something more powerful than a linear system.”

ready driven development

“A perfect implementation of the wrong specification is worthless. By the same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, there’s something very bad going on.”

“It’s a lot simpler to have a discussion based on something written down. It’s easy to talk endlessly and in circles about a problem if nothing is ever put to text. The simple act of writing down a proposed solution means everyone has a concrete idea that can be argued about and iterated upon. 
Consider the process of writing the Readme for your project as the true act of creation. This is where all your brilliant ideas should be expressed. This document should stand on its own as a testament to your creativity and expressiveness. The Readme should be the single most important document in your codebase; writing it first is the proper thing to do.”

optimising for happiness

“The very first commit to GitHub was made exactly three years ago tomorrow. In that time our team of thirteen has signed up over 420,000 developers and now hosts 1.3 million Git repositories, making us the largest code host on the planet. And we’ve done all of this without ever taking a dime of funding from outside the company. In fact, even within the company we only invested a few thousand dollars out of our own pockets during the first months to cover legal fees.”

“In a world dominated by news about Facebook, Apple, Google, YouTube, Zappos, and other companies heavily funded by venture capital, it’s easy to forget that you can still build a highly profitable business with significant impact on a global market without having to first spend three months on Sand Hill Road asking for permission to build your product.”

“GitHub became the leisure activity that I worked on when I got home from the office. I could craft it however I pleased, and there was nobody telling me what to do. This feeling of control and ownership of something you own is intoxicating.”

“A side effect of bootstrapping a sustainable company is what I like to call infinite runway. This is another element of optimizing for happiness. With venture backed endeavors you generally find that during the first several years the numbers in your bank account are perpetually decreasing, giving your company an expiration date. Your VCs have encouraged you to grow fast and spend hard, which makes perfect sense for them, but not necessary for you. Not if you’re trying to optimize for happiness.”

“VCs want to see quick success or quick failure. They are optimizing for money. There’s nothing wrong with that as long as you want the same things they do. But if you’re like me, then you care more about building a kickass product than you do about having a ten figure exit. If that’s true, then maybe you should be optimizing for happiness. One way to do this is by bootstrapping a sustainable business with infinite runway. When there are fewer potentially catastrophic events on the horizon, you’ll find yourself smiling a lot more often.”

“The ironic thing about bootstrapping and venture capital is that once you demonstrate some success, investors will come to YOU. When this happens you will be in a much better place to make a more reasoned choice about taking on additional capital and all the complexities that come with it. Talking to VCs with some leverage in your back pocket is an entirely different game from throwing yourself in front of a conference table full of general partners and trying to persuade them that you’re worth their time and money. Power is happiness.”

“At GitHub we don’t have meetings. We don’t have set work hours or even work days. We don’t keep track of vacation or sick days. We don’t have managers or an org chart. We don’t have a dress code. We don’t have expense account audits or an HR department.

We pay our employees well and give them the tools they need to do their jobs as efficiently as possible. We let them decide what they want to work on and what features are best for the customers. We pay for them to attend any conference at which they’ve gotten a speaking slot. If it’s in a foreign country, we pay for another employee to accompany them because traveling alone sucks. We show them the profit and loss statements every month. We expect them to be responsible.

We make decisions based on the merits of the arguments, not on who is making them. We strive every day to be better than we were the day before.

We hold our board meetings in bars.

We do all this because we’re optimizing for happiness, and because there’s nobody to tell us that we can’t.”

yc optimising for happiness

“30% of github traffic comes from outside of US”

10 lessons from githubs first year

“And so GitHub was born. But it was born into a world where there was no existing market for paid Git hosting. We would be creating the market. I vividly remember telling people, “I don’t expect GitHub to succeed right away. Git adoption will take a while, but we’ll be ready when it happens.” Neither Chris nor I were in any particular hurry for this to happen. I was working full time at Powerset, and he was making good money as a Rails consultant. By choosing to build early on top of a nascent technology, we were able to construct a startup with basically no overhead, no competition, and in our free time.”

“Working on a startup is like that. It feels a bit like college. You’re working on insanely hard projects, but you’re doing it with your best friends in the world and you’re having a great time (usually). In both environments, you have to goof off a lot in order to balance things out. Burnout is a real and dangerous phenomenon. Fostering a playful and creative environment is critical to maintaining both your personal health, and the health (and idea output) of the company.”

“The lesson here is that it’s far easier and less risky to hire based on relevant past performance than it is to hire based on projected future performance. There’s a corollary that also comes into play: if you’re looking to work for a startup (or anyone for that matter), contribute to the community that surrounds it. Use your time and your code to prove that you’re the best one for the job.”

open source almost everything

“Why is it awesome to open source (almost) everything?
If you do it right, open sourcing code is great advertising for you and your company. At GitHub we like to talk publicly about libraries and systems we’ve written that are still closed but destined to become open source. This technique has several advantages. It helps determine what to open source and how much care we should put into a launch. We recently open sourced Hubot, our chat bot, to widespread delight. Within two days it had 500 watchers on GitHub and 409 upvotes on Hacker News. This translates into goodwill for GitHub and more superfans than ever before.”

“Smart people like to hang out with other smart people. Smart developers like to hang out with smart code. When you open source useful code, you attract talent. Every time a talented developer cracks open the code to one of your projects, you win. I’ve had many great conversations at tech conferences about my open source code. Some of these encounters have led to ideas that directly resulted in better solutions to problems I was having with my projects. In an industry with such a huge range of creativity and productivity between developers, the right eyeballs on your code can make a big difference.”

“Once you’ve hired all those great people through their contributions, dedication to open source code is an amazingly effective way to retain that talent. Let’s face it, great developers can take their pick of jobs right now. These same developers know the value of coding in the open and will want to build up a portfolio of projects they can show off to their friends and potential future employers. That’s right, a paradox! In order to keep a killer developer happy, you have to help them become more attractive to other employers. But that’s ok, because that’s exactly the kind of developer you want to have working for you. So relax and let them work on open source or they’ll go somewhere else where they can.”

**Genesis 2:4-3:24 03/07/2016**

Adam and Eve

4 This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.

5 Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth[a] and no plant had yet sprung up,for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, 6 but streams[b] came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. 7 Then the Lord God formed a man[c] from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

8 Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. 9 The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.”

18 The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”

19 Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.
But for Adam[f] no suitable helper was found. 21 So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs[g] and then closed up the place with flesh. 22 Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib[h] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.

23 The man said,
“This is now bone of my bones     and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’     for she was taken out of man.”

24 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.

25 Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.

The Fall

3 Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”

2 The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,3 but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’”

4 “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. 5 “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God,knowing good and evil.”

6 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9 But the Lord God called to the man, “Where are you?”

10 He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked;so I hid.”

11 And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”

12 The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”

13 Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”
The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

14 So the Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this,
“Cursed are you above all livestock     and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly     and you will eat dust     all the days of your life.

15 

And I will put enmity     between you and the woman,     and between your offspring[i] and hers; he will crush[j] your head,     and you will strike his heel.”

16 To the woman he said,
“I will make your pains in childbearing very severe;     with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband,     and he will rule over you.”

17 To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’
“Cursed is the ground because of you;     through painful toil you will eat food from it     all the days of your life.

18 

It will produce thorns and thistles for you,     and you will eat the plants of the field.

19 

By the sweat of your brow     you will eat your food until you return to the ground,     since from it you were taken; for dust you are     and to dust you will return.”

20 Adam[k] named his wife Eve,[l] because she would become the mother of all the living.

21 The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.22 And the Lord God said, “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.” 23 So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. 24 After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side[m] of the Garden of Eden cherubimand a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.

Cops come.

Setting in the arbors.

Cops come.

Pick ups shoot out from craned platforms.

Hundreds of sports cars zoom off.

If there's a crash the 2 cars run into each other explode into bricks a land done.

Mazdas and mclaurens yellow & white sports cars.

Car drives up to spot light under neath dirt. Car disappears, dirt shakes off, car speeds off.

Told from my pov.

Over a 24 period.

Bodies in the snow, need help, dog in the snow. From crashes.

Feb 1.

Im in foreign country, maybe

Old guy & his son walk into my room and claim my desk & clair. No idea who they are.

Whats stranger is they produced a piece of paper & a post it note that I actually wrote. How could they find this? It was written in 

Chicago. Im missed because dad says he doesnt know them, possible "bandits". So now I check with hotel people to see WTF is going on.

Im with some group of friends (bball guys)?

A couple nights before I was sleeping in a room w Rachet & Parth? Outside the window some authorities showed up, I was afraid and I couldnt look/show my face. They were skeptical.




It is good to notice how trends emerge & stories about people. But I have got to create a new path, something unusual not normal. I can not keep comparing myself to other is debilitating my thinking. I can not be disturbed, ruins my focus.

Part of this is if you are not motivated, dont force it. Somehow the brain knows what is neccessary. When it needs info and what if it needs. Don't over analyze. Asking too many questions and getting too deep is spinning tires. Learning helps to be social. Fleshing out ideas with others, things proceed quickly. Reading all the time leads to paralysis.

This trip is life altering.

Ive had conversations with myself that NO ONE could have had. Nor would they want to have.

Why do I do this?

-Remember back on Jonathan. Matt & Dad & Mom would fight because we didnt have money. It was so hard to bear. I will never forget that. I will never go another day without solving that problem. I fucking hate the notion that money can impede life. I just wanted my family to be normal happy safe.

I love the game.

Competition can be blinding. Play Tetris not chess. Being competitive is not bad, it really pushes you to get the most out of what your doing. It is good to have alter egos. Do Tetris but still work alot because playing Tetris and being lazy is just as bad as playing chess. Chess is scientific, linear. Tetris is art, exponential. Play Tetris but have a scientific mindset. Thats where art & science intermix. Art is 80% of results, science is 20%. Art > science. Art/contrarian/

Art & science can apply in so many ways. Not just tour title. Every decision can be classified differently. If you are a scientist, does not mean you can not be an artistic thinker. Same goes with being an artist, does not mean you can not be scientific.

The art & science I talk about is distinguishable from the fields of art & science. I am referring to reasoning/mindset.


Interesting ways to write.

-take me down the rabit hole (sort out complexity)

-life wisdom (loving & caring) mentor/teacher/advisor

-emotion (mockingbird)

-conspiracy

-controversy

-

Time demand is not bad. But it will trade off purest form of long term building.


MANSION

Living in a mansion. Not really happy. Somedays I go to Bball. Other days I hang out with Maddie emrich. I traveled coast to coast to hang out w friends &  discover. Showering in street alley in mansion was weird. Always exploring. Moving city to city. Took an unusual long pee. Ben Slezak in it.

**Feynman Series -- MOBILE 01/29/2016**

LECTURE 1 - Gravity

Force - all nature obeys it.

All results are from Force.

Copernicus - credited for dissemination of heliocentric theory.

Brachus Tyhco - at home uses instruments to record movement of planetary objects

Kepler - analyzes Tyhcos data. Theorizes 3 laws of planetary motion.

Ellipticals

Equal areas at equal times

? Wiki

Galileo - initeria. Observed inclined panes and pendulums

Newton - force needed to change velocity

planets do not continue "coasting"

Force pulling planets towards sun (path)

Same gravity pulling apple toward ground pulls moon toward earth

Force varies inversely as the square of the distance (on the elliptical)

Explained circular shape of Earth

Became newtons laws -- verified by jupiters moons orbiting

Velocity of light

Study of gravity lead to discovery of speed of light.

Gravity extends to others stars.

Kavanish: determined mass of earth *

Inverse square law appears in electricity laws between charges

Mystery: gravitation (universe) to electric (proton) ratio (42 digits)

Quantum theory: study of gravity on a small (atomical? Scale)

Gravity is mathematical in it is expression, so are others.

Einstein is not exact. No quantum theory.

Gravity is simple & beautiful. In its pattern. Complicated in action.

Gravity was so universal.

LECTURE 2 - Mathematics & Physics

Virus & Bacteria Not Mathematical

Genetics are mathematical

Chess moves are binary very fundamental (incremental). But strategy requires deep mathematical thinking to make the best decision.

Fundamentals are not very mathematical at all, dont need to calculate. Let the computer deal with mathematical complexity.

In physics we needmathematics for fundamentals.

Faradays law - not mathematical

Netwons law - speed at which mathematical symbols can carry information

Fundamentals are a result of large numbers.

Formulas are machines. They deal with complexity & explain.

Disease of mathematics. Difficult to understand all the factors & complexities effecting a given phenomenon.

"Kind to the Laymen"

Mathematics is a language plus reasoning. Language plus logic. It's a tool for reason. Collection of some persons reasoning or thought.

Laws of nature are very closely woven & intertwined based on logic.

Mathematics is organized reasoning.

*Explains mathematics of planetary orbit*

-Newton's Principia (Geometry)

-He invented Calculus: rate of change for observable behavior (Relations of Mathematics to Physics)

-When physics get mathematically complex have to talk to mathematicians to see if they experienced this reasoning in their work.

-If no experience, invent it.

-When reasoning, record & contribute to books of knowledge.

-Mathematics explains conseqeuences and results

-All laws & physics statements are interconnected by reasoning.

-Patterns. Fundamentals (bottom-up) or consequences (top-down)

-Euclid: all axioms of geometry can be explained with a few simple rules.

No right place to start when it comes to mathematics.

You may not always get to the theorem based on where you start.

But its very efficient if you connect a few dots. And do what you are capable of.

Equal area & equal time.

Sum of these areas is always the same.

Called angular momentum.

Law of conversation of momentum.

Empircally significant in quantum mechanics as well.

*Programming vs. Biohack

Physics is messy because the laws do not have a starting point. But still need mathematics & reasoning. Mathematics is pure, has a starting point.

3 ways to explain gravity.

PERSPECTIVES

-Newton's Law explains an instance in time (unlocal). Action at a distance.

-Ball explains what happens irrelevant of time & space. Local & timeless. Field perspective.

-Easiest & simple path one particle to next. (Minimum)

Equivalent scientifically, however inequivalent psychologically.

-Minimum principles + local laws are the best.

Understand & try all alternatives in our head. All the different combinations.

"Variety of interpretational schemes"

Physics can always be explained in a variety of possible ways. Interesting.

Mathematicians prepare abstract reasoning thats ready to be used if you only have a set of axioms about the real world. Physicists add meaning to all the phrases.

Mathematicians & physists complement each other.

Mathematicians like to make there reasoning as general as possible.

Physicists do not want to talk about abstracts, he is talking about something SPECIFIC and observable. Physicists reduce the thinking of the mathematicians.

Mathematics are purely theoretical.
Physicists are more practical, do not require the mathematical rigor & thoroughness.

Mathematics is a abstract way of expressing the physicial world in an philosphical manner. But not time efficient. Guess & check is time efficient. EXPERIMENTATION.

The great architect seems to be a mathematician.

The horizons are limited & the center of the universe is man. Garden.

LECTURE 3 - Great Conservation Priciples

3 Main Principles of Physics

Conservation

Symmetry

Quantum Mechanics

Mathematics


Conservation of electrical charge (total charge does not charge)

n = e + p

e- + e+ = light (anti particle)

Reactions always has to balance.

Charge is locally conserved.

Theory of relativity.

two observers cannot determine who is moving

Impossible to have unlocal conservation of charge (relativity)

Charges come in units

Measure of electric field is the electricity.

Source of a field

Bayrian Number = protons + neutrons + lambdas - anti protons - anti neutrons

Hyperion charge (strangeness #)

-lambda gets -, proton gets 0, k+ gets +

Law of conservation of energy... No units.

Most abstract & useful.

Types of Energy:

Thermal - kinetic energy of motion within particles

Motion - Kinetic & Potential

Gravitation

Electrical - formula is quantum mechanical

Light - electrical energy

Elastic - forces between atoms... It is kinetic and electric

Chemical - forces between atoms (heat)... It is kinetic and electric

Nuclear - result of nuclear forces

Energy of Existence (mass)

E=mc2

W x height = gravity energy

Atoms are balls globed together. When you step on the floor you displace atoms, some left jiggling. The jiggling is thermal energy. Energy hides, so we need instruments.

Law of conservation of energy is true for life (metabolism) and non life forms.

Physics of non living & living things are not different.

Calories are heat energy.

BTUs, Volts, Calories, kWatts, Kelvin..

Quasars, difficult to understand not because fundamental laws are wrong but because details are unknown. ** Quantum

Neutrinos **

Not a mistake when fundamentals are wrong. They explored a new uncertain area.

Angular momentum in a magnetic field

Induction of electricity spins energy.

Conservation laws are ironically related and connected in ways which normally would seem miraculous. Example: angular momentum implies momentum

Rocket thrusts. Avg mass unchanged but one part is interesting & other part uninteresting.

"Physics is all one big puzzle, we know it is because of the interconnectedness of the fundamental characteristics."

LECTURE 4 - Symmetry

Human minds love symmetry

Symmetry defined: change it in some way, and it looks the same. *Happens in physics

Translation in space: one apparatus & other apparatus, experiment, same result // all variables which have any influence as well

Translation(delay) in time: one planet around sun, do same thing in 2 hours

Origins of the universe are unknown (fact of the universe)... So a delay in time is relatively meaningless.

Coordinates on a plane. If you turn it in space, there is a mathematical way of representing it. Delta x delta y

Uniform velocity in a straight line (symmetry). This is called relativity.

One moving & other still. One cannot determine who is moving.

So when it comes to symmetry, if we move one apparatus we are not talking about moving time with it.

Uniform velocity in a straight line (symmetry). "relative to the average of the rest of the nebuli" sees no effect... When you look out from the car, you see no effect.

Add constant speed, laws are still the same. According to newton.

Electromagnetic waves (ex light) moves at 186,000 mi/sec

186,000mi/sec no matter how fast I move.

A different perspective is witnessing a different time. At a uniform velocity in a straight line.

Time and space are forever interlinked.

The same point from one perspective looks different from another location.

Have to define a point in space and time (4 dimensions)

Time & space are interchangable. One term.
**Analogous to quibits?

Symmetry of replacing atoms. Consequences for quantum mechanics. Liquid nitrogen flows smoothly through pipes. Interesting phenomenon.

Symmetry does not scale. (Atoms)

A bone 2x big does not support an animal 4x as big (Galileo).

We dont have theories explaining effects of galaxy on our solar system.

*All motion is not relative

Reflection in space. Physical laws are not always reflective.

Physics & chemistry can create right & left pronged proteins but biology can distinguish between these two types.

Conversation with an alien..

Properties of physics are unchanged at scale. "People are 170 million hydrogen's tall"

How to explain left & right? The spin of electrons.

Conservation & symmetry deeply connected in quantum physics. Using minimal property.

Matter & anti-matter behave in same way. Symmetrical.

Matter & anti matter have right/left threads.

99.9% of nature cant explain left/right but the little turn of the electron can.



LECTURE 5 - Distinction of Past & Future

Phenomenon of the world are evidently irreversible. Things happen that do not happen the other way. Seems obvisious & weird to study it deeply.

Experiences inside are completely different. We remember the past, we dont remember the future. Our awareness of what has happened is different than what might happen. The past & future look completely different psychologically. We believe we can affect the future, but no way to affect the past. Remorse regret hope.

Obvisous distinction between past and future. Obvious irreversibility of everything. Seems to be all motion laws are going one way. But, in all the physics so far no distinction between past & future.

The of gravitation is time reversibile.

Electricity & magnetism time reversible.

Nuclear

Beta decay ?

Earth rotation has friction. Friction irreversible.

"Accidents of life." its unlikely they blue & white molecules would bounce into each other. And that is the answer. Life is bendable.

Irreversibility of nature does not come from the fundamental irreversibility of physical law, it comes from starting an ordered system & and having unordered events take place, which the outcome is unknown.

How is it possible that it started ordered?

Ordered state need not be interesting.

We can tell something from the present about the past.

Physicists say these are the conditions this is what will happen next. But historians say something happened and something else will coincide with that.

When we look at other stars we see the ordermess.

We conclude in the past the world was more ordered.

Distinguish between how the world was ordered in the past AND how the world develops going forward.

Making a saw machine that is irreversible. Friction & heat energy.

The saw keeps going because it is out of equilibrium.

No way to harness thermal energy in ocean because its not out of equilibrium.

If you leave a system long enough, theres no energy left to really do anything with. Equilibrium.

Same temp.

Irreversibility is if things are at different temp & left to themselves as time goes on, then availability of energy is decreasing. This is entropy. Not energy is always increasing. Due to chaos of the world.

One way is always loss of availability of energy.

Laws of physics not directly relevance to experience. Laws are abstract from experience.

Understanding the fundamentals doesnt make sense of the pic, it is partially.

World seems to be a complicated example of alot of accidental laws.

In the begginning of the world, it was practically all hydrogen. Hydrogen could only create a dozen elements. Where did others come from?

Understanding the physical laws does not give understanding of significance. Details of real experience are very far off the fundamental laws. (Levers). 

Hierarchies of complexity. Interconnected.

-Fundamentals of physical

-thermal energy

-surface tension

-storm

-sun spot

-star

-nerve impulse

-man

-history

-evil

-beauty

-hope

-everyone working togetherness

LECTURE 6 -- Probability & Uncertainty: The Quantum Mechanical View of Nature.

Experimental.

Intuition - interaction with everyday objects suggest reasonable explanation of things.

Simple explanations become laws. But as time goes on they become less intuitively obvious.

Relativity is just a subject of opinion.

Personal view is very narrow and limited, only thru experimentation can we get a wider view. Then we see unexpected things. Imagination get streched far enough just to comprehend those things that are there.

Light - rain of particles, but it was actually waves, but it behaves likes particles. Quantum mechanics formula explained it. Behavior is unique.

How they behave is different so it takes imagination to understand how it works. It's abstract, unlike any experience. Difficulty comes from psychological torment. No analogies.

*Nobody understands quantum. 1946.

Analogy & constrast. Bullets & waves.

2 Holes Experiment.

Shaky Gun

Bullets Dont Fracture

Particles (graph of catches = wave graph)

Bullets come in lumps.

Probability of arrival. 2.5/hr sine graph

N12=N1+N2 ... No interference

Waves (frequent & increasing wave graph to a point)

Comes in any size

I12/=I1+I2

"constructive interference"

Height is h1+h2 but intensity is h^2

Electrons we receive clicks. Come in lumps. Never come at same time for different detectors.

Comes in lumps.

Probability of arrival (per hour, avg) 2.5 electrons

But arrives graph is like waves.

Interference I1/=I2

*Electrons arrives in lumps like particles, but the probsbilty of arrival of these lumps is determined like the intensity of waves. Sometimes it behaves like a particle, sometimes like a wave. Finalize mathematics.

Light behind hole. Catches like a sine graph. Light off catches like a crazy wave.

So light effects the motion of electrons. Or protons affect distribution of electrons. In light sine wave, no light crazy wave.

Eisenberg discovered quantum mechanics.

Uncertainty principle - when we dont look/shine light it goes through, when we do it produces an error.

If you do have the light on, which hole of goes through is unpredictable. The future is unpredictable.

Impossible to have information ahead of time about which hole it will go through. Nature intrinsically does not know which way to go.

Future of man depends on something that no amount of science can predict. Future is unpredictable.

Nature is not to be determined by pompous preconditions. They are determined by the materially with which we work with Nature herself. We observe what we find, and we cannot see ahead of time.

What is neccessary for existence of science?

Ability to experiment

Honesty to report results

Intelligence to interpret results (shouldnt be sure ahead of time, but it can be prejudice) you can dislike something but not strict 
bias. Because experiments will keep getting ran until you cannot ignore facts.

Neccessary for the very existence of science, that minds exist, that do not allow that nature must satisfy some preconceived conditions in our philosphy.

I never believe I failed, I just took a different path. If something doesnt work dont regress, use it to find something that will work.



LECTURE 7 - Seeking New Laws

How we stand relative to nature now. What we know, what to guess.

"Laws of Something"

Matter of stars & earth all the same thing. Living & unliving.

Nothing but atoms. With nuclear structure.

Things we know: x2 anti-matter

Electrons

Nuclei - nuetrons & protons

Light (photons)

Gravitons

Neutrino

All Low energy phenomenons are explained by ^^^ (AFAIK)

Atoms explain life.

Beta decay (N --> p + e + neutrino)

TBD:

Extrasensory perception?

Astrological influences?

Hypnotism?

Forces between neutrons & protons?

-Colliders help us study this. Create new particles. (Sigma, Beta, etc.)

-Ephemeral (are they even significant?)

-Families *(locate missing particles)

-Strong nuclear forces btw pp, pn, nn indistinguishable. *Does not work for electrical forces.

Muon? 227x mass

Neutrino with new mezzan?

Principles... Too many

-quantum mechanics

-conservation

-locallity

-passive assumptions

-sweep infinities under rug

-mutex (gives trouble)

Assumption that might be wrong.

-energy must always be positive

-causality (effects cannot proceed their causes)

-proposotion of probabily

-locality

-quantum mechanics

-no models have been made to disregard these

How To Find New Law

Guess

Compute conseqences of the guess

Compare to experience or nature

If it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong. *Key to science. (after checking for errors)

Experiment where no one knows whats happening.

Experiment produces trouble (unexpected results) --- good start to guess

Can not prove something right, only temporarily right. Because tomorrow experiment may prove what we thought was right, wrong.

"We are never right, we can only be sure when we are wrong."

Trying to prove ourselves wrong ASAP. This is how we find progress.

We need to explore areas which are unknown.

No one knows where to look breadth & depth in fundamental law. Everyone is looking at high energy.

Can not prove something wrong if theory is vague. If theory is vague anything can look to be a consequence.

Jockeying around is first step towards progress. True in anything. Be careful in begginning. Takes experience & skill to not walk off the game.

We may get stuck in guessing stage or computing stage or experimental.

Theoretical physicists. How do you make the guesses? Not important where guess comes from, only important it agrees with experiment & definite.

Guessing is an art. So where to start?

Not what might be wrong but what might be substituted precisely in place of it. Dont say something might be wrong, replace it with something.

Natures imagination far surpasses our own. Subtle and deep. Need to be clever to guess.

Newtons ideas relatively close to experiment.

Maxwell (electricity & magnetism) all laws before him were mutex and mathematically inconsistent. Invented an equation & apparatus. 
Equation was correct. Logic may be wrong but answer is correct.

Relativity - accumulation of paradoxes, new kinds of thinking, discussing new possible symmetries of laws. Time & space & Newton's law proved wrong.

Quantum mechanics discovered in 2 independent ways. Enormous number of paradoxes accumulated. Knowledge was too complete.
Schredenger guessed equation. Eisenberg analyze whats measurable.

Incomplete knowledge and only the equation was guessed. Special difficulty was experiments were all wrong. Get answer but experiment wrong.

No paradoxes today.

Knowledge is incomplete.

History does not repeat itself.

New discovery wipes away the old.

Eisenberg - "shouldnt talk about what you cant measure."

The constructs you invent must be computable for experiment. Consequences being compared to experiment.

Extend ideas beyond their range. Uncertain but neccessary for progress.

If you assume entire behavior is only good for known laws, this is a very limited assumption, easily broken if false so push it.

Biological world is a result of physical & chemical something.

Not unscientific to take a guess.

More scientific to define unlikely & likely rather then proven or impossible.

If you are wrong, discuss other possibilities.

What to keep & what to throw away takes skill.

Guessing quantum is right because its consistent to nuclear.

Guessing space is not continuous, geometry not extensible to subatomic.

Guessing all known things are all fundamentals that exist.

Use vital few givens, deal with complexity, take a guess.

**Meaning of partial symmetries. Neurons & protons are almost symmetrical.

Nature in our heart is simple, but in the complexity of realities get aprox.

2 Theories same result. Psychologically they are not equivalent. Gives you an idea of what to change in the theory. Must keep each theories (6 or 7) alternatives in their head. In order to guess in the future.

Philosophical ideas between Netwon & Einstein gravitation are enormous. Philosphies are tricky ways to compute consequences quickly. 

A philosphy is an understanding of a law. A way a person hold the laws in her mind. To guess quickly at consequences.

Only guessing and having no philospy is bad. Blind guesses & philosphy guesses combined is good, neither is wrong in this case.

**just because something is underdeveloped does not mean its wrong, others will shoot you down.

Einstein guessed forces are all propositional to the masses.

Opening & closing of switches is quite different than what is happening in nature. Surprising. Quantum computing.

Easy to recognize truth with beauty & simplicity.

When you think its simpler than you thought you are right.

Inexperience = simple guesses obvisiously wrong, or contrive complications and it sort of looks right but not right. 

We need imagination but imagination in a terrible straight jacket. A new view of the world that agrees with known but disagree in its predictions somewhere, otherwise not interesting. And that disagreement agrees with nature. Over all things that agree with the world but find one thing that doesnt agree, you have made great discovery.

Could end where we discover every law, or could end when we figure out 99.9% of laws and it gets very uninteresting.

Lucky to live in an age of discovery. An age that will never come again. Discovery of America. We are discovering fundamental laws of nature. We are not finished, in the process. This will eventually have to go. In future there will be other interests. 

If all is known, the vigorous attention to detail will fade. That type of reasoning will not permit us to go further. There will be a degeneration of ideas.

Nature has a simplicity therefore a great beauty.

"The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements.” - Nikola Tesla

"All men who hear the truth hear my voice."

"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."
