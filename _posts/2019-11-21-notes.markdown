campfire lyrics 09/19/2019

our journey comes to an end with music of drama

one specific frequency to effect the way we behave

*it’s too random...* specific at extremely low frequencies

but generally what you hear on the radio is terrible

i think basically it’s a product and the reason it is being 

manufactured is just to make money and it seems to me to have very little to do with, um, the basic reasons for making music in the first place

we’ll show you on energy on, on ground tracks, NAV is go, copy endeavor runway in sight

on this side we have some widely contrasting examples taken from recent recordings, to give you some idea of the wealth of recorded music now available on the wider tapestry of stereophonic sound.. we hope you’ve enjoyed this journey through sound....! ❤️

I want to share a few things...

These seem obvious but just want to make sure it’s been stated.

I want you to know if you are reading this, you should never *ever* worry about being remembered. You will be...! We are getting close to a special, special place and it feels like it will happen sooner than later. I don’t know what this place look/feels like quite yet. But, it’s going to be really incredible. I’m really excited.

Everything you do matters...! Really cliche, but more true than ever now. Be careful!!! I find myself revisiting the most basic stuff everyday, I guess that’s how things go these days.

Stay positive, please, really begging you.

I’m spending a good chunk of my time decoding things. If communication is to be clear and precise, I need phone numbers!! Ladies, this is not an invitation.

Stick with me, I’m trying...! Always trust yourself 🙏🏼


**** in fact, if somethings unclear, it might not even be worth sharing





I’m awake usually 16 hrs/day (102 hr/week). I go to the gym for 1-2 hrs, 3 days a week (5 hrs/week). I play basketball for 3-4 hours, 3 times a week (11 hrs/week). I need a few hours to chill per day generally (11 hrs/wk). I drive for uber one day a week usually for 8-10 hrs in one day. Add all that up, add in some hours for multitasking, and thats only roughly 60-80 working hours. I need to eat, healthy food. Sometimes I cook which requires time. I need to shower. I have housemates. I do my own laundry weekly. I like to dress up sometimes, but rarely get to because it takes time, and I’m usually living out of a suitcase. I’m $30k in debt. I never had a paycheck ever in my life and have never been in debt like this until recently. I have friends I like to see sometimes. I travel to see my family 3-4 times a year. While traveling things are a bit crazy. I have to do most of the things a normal, average person would do every day/week at the moment.

So, 60 working hours a week if I’m lucky.

I rarely have time to think about image because I’m just trying to keep everything in order.

Just 3 years ago, I was seriously a nobody. Just an average dude walking around.

I just found out like 3 weeks ago that I was VIP.

The last 3 weeks has seriously been a complete blur. I don’t know what’s happening. I rarely know what day of the week it is. Time is just a blur to me.

I’m going to start having to take alot of drugs just to survive on the daily. I’ve never taken drugs like this until recently. I don’t like doing drugs. Drugs are really unpredictable. Especially the newer ones.

**if im not fed, ill be in a bad mood

*** Let me know if anything I said is wrong or out of line.

Love & Marriage 08/23/2019

modern love nytimes

http://www.chronicle.com/article/I-Have-Multiple-Loves-/239077

Marriage. I've been thinking a lot lately about marriage. I always had questions but now they are deeper. Generally, you grow up optimistic about marriage & it exists as a vague event far out on the horizon. Everyone marries for different reasons & at different ages. Personally, I began to ask questions in my 20's. How do I find someone to marry? What's the point of a wedding? But, more recently my questions have been,  is marriage a necessity? Do I have to be religious to get married? Once you have a kid, do you have to get married? (Write a related post about kids lol.) What happens if it's not for me? Or even worse, what happens if I get divorced😱? These are all hard questions because I don't know if marriage is right for me.

Today there are a lot of people who marriage works for! This is great. I'm thankful my parents have been married for 30+ years. But the problem is a large majority of folks who it doesn't work for.

And the problem with marriage isn't people, it's the institution. But somehow couples gets publicly shamed for divorce.

Marriage is an inherently old tradition. The world is changing fast. Take everything great about marriage and practice it. Instead of a wedding, have a fun celebration that takes all of the fun things from a wedding but no rituals. The best thing about this, is should things not work out in the relationship of the couple, you never had the chance of deceiving the guests. This will save a lot of embarrassment & unnecessary gossip. Simply by removing the rituals. Imagine this, couple throws a (noun for non-marriage party) everything goes great on that day, months later things change & couple separates. I imagine the congregation saying, "well at least it was one hell of a party". And that's the way it should be. No one should actually care if the couple stays together or not. Because relationships are highly personal.

Today, people are partially deceived into thinking they have to have a wedding or get married. Truth is you can create whatever life you want.

Better yet, later on if a couple wants to be officially married do it privately with the church. But it's healthy to acknowledge the celebration/party and the religious tradition of a wedding don't mix.

Assuming the economy is stable and holding all other factors stable, we will begin to see a shift away from marriage. Love is not ending, but the institution is heavy, and the environment requires agility.

Bell curve of successful marriages/relationships.

The best systems always allow human nature freedom not forcing human nature into a defined area. Relationships should allow this same flexibility.

Life expectancy has big implications for the delay of marriage.

I'm still young and naive.. I think. But, these are real things as a 23 year old.

I'm 23 years old, and these are my thoughts on marriage.
One night stands: it might happen. Not the best idea.

Capitalist Dating

I do not know if the trend is good or bad. But, it is.

Whether your single or married, make the best with what you have.

As more & more women are single and can economically sustainable the only reason love will exist is sex & companionship.
Modern markets also allow women to play a greater economic role, which lead to their greater independence. And the expansion ofdemocracy, with its emphasis on liberty and individual choice, may also have stacked the deck for love matches.
Polyamory will become more common.
 "We now believe it is based on love, mutual sexual attraction, equality and a flexible division of labor." Can exist between multiple partners.

Monogamy may seem central to marriage now, but in fact, polygamy was common throughout history. From Jacob, to Kings David and Solomon, Biblical men often had anywhere from two to thousands of http://www.livescience.com/37777-history-of-wives.
marriage.html
At this opposite extreme are the likes of basketball player Wilt Chamberlain, who claimed to have slept with 20,000 women.

Sex often brings with it confusion about what the partner ultimately seeks in terms of a relationship. "A sexual encounter occurs, and one partner assumes it has meaning and endurance and the other partner never assumed that from the beginning," Smith said.

http://www.livescience.com/16465-monogamy-polygamy-human-behavior.html

The catholic church fabricated monogamy as an institution in the 9th century. Prior to this, polygamy was often practiced.

The only thing that matters in a modern relationship are trust and sexual attraction.

But, maybe marriage is not for me.

Q 08-18-2019

feynman quote...

Man can fail. They can be caught, killed, & forgotten. But an idea cannot. 400 years later, an idea can still change the world.

There is a face beneath this mask. But it's not me. I am no more the face than the muscles beneath it or the bones beneath them.

Beneath this mask, there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Cready. And ideas are bulletproof.

Who was he? He was Edmund Dantes. He was my father, and my mother; My brother, my friend, he was you and me. He was all of us.

Fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words they are perspectives.

People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.

The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements.” - Nikola Tesla

The miracle of your mind is that you can see the world as it isn't. We can imagine the future, we can remember the past.

The miracle of your mind is that you can see the world as it isn't. We can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place.

We need to think big, we need to think cheap, we need to think about the problem differently.

We owe it to our children & grandchildren.

We can't just bomb our way out, were gunna invent our way out, working together.

We have the tools, we have the passion; we can be more, we can be much more.

The city of the future calls on you, to see it thru, will you dream with me, will you build with me?

We have 3 billion new minds coming online, to do that which we must do.

The value and veracity as such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and virtuous... I don't play God and I don't believe in coincidence.

BNC Video

I do appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine, the security of the familiar, the tranquility & the repetition. I enjoy them as much as anyone. But in the spirit of commemoration, which are associated with important events in the past, someone's death, some bloody struggle, are celebrated with a nice holiday... There are those who do not want us to speak. Orders are being shouted into telephones & men with guns are on their way. Why? Because why the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always remain their power. Words are the means to meaning. And for those who will listen the annunciation of truth. And the truth is there is something terribly wrong with this country. Cruelty and injustice intolerance and oppression and once you have the freedom to object, to think & speak as you saw fit, you now have senses, and systems of set silence coercing your conformity and subversing your submission... Those will be held accountable. If you are looking for the guilty you need only to look into a mirror... There are a million reasons why they rob you and try to corrupt you of your common sense, fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the high chancellor. He promised order & peace, and in return all he asked was your silent obedience & consent... Fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words they are perspectives.

***Regardless of how much sensor ship is placed on a society, fairness, justice, and freedom will be everlasting. Perspectives cannot be destroyed and cannot be forgotten.

Blowing up the parliament will solve everything? No certainty, only opp.

People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.

A building is a symbol, as is the symbol of destroying it. A symbol is powerful with a bunch of people behind it. It can change the world.

Artists use lies to tell the truth while politicians use lies to cover them up.

By the power of truth, I, while living have conquered the universe.
From Faust, trying to cheat the devil

Oppenheimer was able to change more than the course of just a war, he changed the entire course of human history.

I have not come for what you hoped to do, I have come for what you did.

There are no coincidences, only the illusion of coincidences.

My father wouldn't look at me, he told me to go and never come back, my mother wouldn't look at me. But I only told them the truth. Was that so selfish? Our integrity sells for so little but it's all we really have. It's the very last inch we have. But in that inch we are free.

Words are power.

Different became dangerous. I don't understand why they hate us so much.

I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish, but one inch. It is small and it is fragile, and it is the only thing in the world worth having. You must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us.

Even though I do not know you, even though I may not meet you, lust with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you, with all my heart. I love you. Valerie.

You have no fear anymore. You are completely free.

What was done to me created me. That's a basic principal of the universe. Every action creates an opposite and equal reaction.

There is a face beneath this mask. But it's not me. I am no more the face than the muscles beneath it or the bones beneath them.

Beneath this mask, there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Cready. And ideas are bulletproof.

Who was he? He was Edmund Dantes. He was my father, and my mother; My brother, my friend, he was you and me. He was all of us.







Summary 

words will always remain their power. Words are the means to meaning. And for those who will listen the annunciation of truth. 

Fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words they are perspectives.

***Regardless of how much sensorship is placed on a society, fairness, justice, and freedom will be everlasting. Perspectives cannot be destroyed and cannot be forgotten.

Our integrity sells for so little but it's all we really have. It's the very last inch we have. But in that inch we are free.

I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish, but one inch. It is small and it is fragile, and it is the only thing in the world worth having. You must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us.

Even though I do not know you, even though I may not meet you, lust with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you, with all my heart. I love you. Valerie.

Benefits Of Writing 07/21/2019

http://lifehacker.com/the-psychological-benefits-of-writing-regularly-1783693547

https://www.helpscout.net/blog/benefits-of-writing/

https://www.helpscout.net/blog/creative-cringe/


The Therapeutic Aspects of Writing

Much of the research on writing and happiness deals with “expressive writing,” or jotting down what you think and how you feel. Even blogging “undoubtedly affords similar benefits” to private expressive writing in terms of therapeutic value.
Expressive writing has also been linked to improved mood, well-being, and reduced stress levels for those who do it regularly, says 

Adam Grant:
“Research by Laura King shows that writing about achieving future goals and dreams can make people happier and healthier... And Jane Dutton and I found that when people doing stressful fundraising jobs kept a journal for a few days about how their work made a difference, they increased their hourly effort by 29% over the next two weeks.”
Moreover, laziness with words creates difficulty in describing feelings, sharing experiences, and communicating with others. Being able to flesh out thoughts in your mind only to have them come stumbling out when you speak is supremely frustrating. Fortunately, regular writing seems to offer some reprieve.
In both emotional intelligence and in hard sciences like mathematics, writinghas been shown to help people communicate highly complex ideas more effectively. Writing helps eliminate “it sounded good in my head” by forcing your hand; brains forgive fuzzy abstractions, prose does not.


Writing and Gratitude

As the authors of one study noted, subjects who reflected on the good things in their life once a week by writing them down were more positive and motivated about their current situations and their futures.
The catch was, when they wrote about them every day, the benefits were minimal. This makes sense; any activity can feel disingenuous and just plain boring if done too often. It seems like the key is to reflect and write about gratitude regularly, but not begrudgingly often.

Writing and Learning

Information often sticks better when it’s learned as though it needs to be taught or re-written in your own words. This concept of having a “writer’s ear” never fully clicked with me until I started writing regularly.
There’s a certain discipline required to create interesting written work that demands the individual be receptive and focused on finding new sources of information, inspiration, and insight. I’ve read books, listened to podcasts/radio, and watched videos I would normally have put off in order to learn something new so that I might write about later.
Simply being a curator of good ideas encourages deeper thinking, research, and “heading down the rabbit hole” in order to find unique takes on topics that matter to you. Committing to creating a volume of work also allows you to tackle big ideas more effectively.
Writing around a certain topic for some time will allow you to build off of older thoughts, utilizing what you’ve already written to develop ideas on a grander scale—I’m sure many writers have written a paragraph that lead to an essay, which lead to a series of articles, which lead to a book.

Writing as Leadership at Scale

Though the world may now be drowning under the “personal brand” deluge, there are sincerely interesting opportunities that an “anyone can publish” world brings about.
The ability to leave an impact at scale through your words alone is an astounding concept. There’s a bit of a creative shock the first time someone emails you, thanking you for the work you’ve put out and sharing how it has helped or influenced them.
Without a doubt, the positive feedback for this “leadership at scale” leads to gratitude and further motivation for the writer.
Even in the face of criticism, writers learn to build thick skins like few others. Criticism, even unwarranted, is the breakfast of champions.

“The writer, having tossed up some suitably interesting pins, knows they have to come down, and, in my experience, the greatest pleasure in writing fiction is when they come down in a surprising way that conveys more and better meaning than you’d had any idea was possible. One of the new pleasures I experienced writing this, my first novel, was simply that the pins were more numerous, stayed in the air longer, and landed in ways that were more unforeseen and complexly instructive to me than has happened in shorter works.”

“I’m not responsible for your life, you are.

Bye take care I wish you well”

Im not sure how my life has gotten off the wrong track. But, it has. I don’t feel well anymore. I feel overwhelmed. I feel sick, everyday. I don’t feel human. I’m never myself anymore. And I’m so sorry for all this.

I can’t go on in pain anymore.

I will always appreciate the times we had together. I love you forever. Please be well.

micah whats your problem? no one thinks there cooler than anyone, you lost. were all moving on with our lives, nobody cares (i certainly dont), life isnt about winning and losing. i have other more important goals in life than “beating” other people like helping society and i plan on accomplishing those goals. if you wanna be a good friend and contribute with positive energy, make some lifestyle changes. i’ve told u over and over to stop being a psycho and u wont, at first it was funny since then its been really really bad. i repeat myself all the time to you, especially with the bitcoin stuff. after a while it’s very disrespectful to me and everything ive worked for in my life. u keep digging yourself a deeper hole, not sure why, do the right thing man. i hope u make lots of money off bitcoin, i could care less. the real problem with all of this is your actually ruining my life because all u worry about is bitcoin and u think its gunna solve all your problems. go read a book or something, wake the fuck up, figure things out for yourself. and if u think moneys gunna solve all your problems your a retard. money doesnt do anything, it might actually make life worse. figure out your life man, im tired of it. your ruining our friendship with the bitcoin stuff, its really sad.

i dont have a problem with this text group but i cant always respond nor do i want to, sometimes i dont mind acting like a retard with Tourettes but i also want to be normal person doing work sometimes too. ive been with my family, who i rarely see, and are getting older fast, so im trying to spend quality time with them instead of reading these wild conspiracy theories you throw out all the time.

Negotiation Strategy 11/17/2017

Johnny————— 

How am I being compensated if we take top down approach:

“Here is our investment thesis and this is how we make picks” only revealing they need to know at a minimum.




Culturally - How are we defining culture?

Culturally I’m not comfortable going out and meeting folks and telling them this is our team and they're great when it is not true.

At the end of the day, I have to go to Alyse and everyone I meet and tell them this is Johnny and this is Archie and I recommend them.

I am seriously considering leaving the project, I am not going to fight over politics in order to be compensated fairly.

We are going to do things the right way. Start over.

/*I have got enough connections at this point to basically do whatever I want.*/

We operate under full transparency. I have complete control over what happens. Compensation is 

If we operate under “only what you need to know” outlook.

If we operate with full transparency and openness


Piece-wise, only reveal to Archie and johnny what they need to know to move forward.

Give archie a big share of the profits

35% archie 35% mitch remaining 40%

Voting

Mitch 60% remaining 40%

Archie actually has not done much.

-Hanieh Consensys

-

Short-term profits have to be agreed upon.

It is about what is actually about happening behind the scenes.

It is about being honest about who is actually driving the value.

Everyone is going to be listening to me at the end of the day.

Never be exposed for lack of preparation.

At the end of the day, I have to go to Alyse and everyone I meet and tell them this is Johnny and this is Archie and I recommend them.

My reputation is on the line. I want to operate under full-transparency.

“If you want to be apart of this, this is how we are going to operate”


Peita——————— 

Culturally, I do not think it is smart at this point to operate under only secrecy. That is old way of thinking and does not produce the best results.

I’d prefer we do bottom-up approach and structure the MOU the correct honest way.

Open salaries. Open everything. Completely flat organization. Not hierarchical.

I am going to approach Johnny and say we are not going to operate in a hierarchical manner.

—————————

How we talk to LPs has implications for our culture.

You said culture is important…

1. Is culture only important to you when it strategically makes sense for your interests?

2.Transparency and fairness

Define why we went with 25% splits in the first place?


Hey man,

Can you and I have a call today to discuss the MOU after yesterday’s calls?

-Mitch

At a minimum move forward on profit sharing.

An Anonymity Protocol: 11/04/2017

1. Acquire prepaid gift cards

- burner phone (buy new, unlocked)

- burner laptop (buy new, nothing preinstalled)

- use burner internet (public wifi)

- designate and borrow workspace (only do work in this location) preferably a public place with public wifi and not connected in anyway to your identity (can be in the same city but the farther away the better)

Configure laptop settings (offline)

Using the laptop:

- custom build a vpn (using a public wifi network)

Using the vpn (create a virtual pseudo person):

- set up an anonymous email

- create anonymous accounts for any internet service you may need

- when needed: accumulate reputation under a pseudonym (blogs, Reddit, forums, etc)

If we were to do a token for the hedgefund under a pseudonym:

2. Write the token white paper under the pseudonym

- utility

- execute all the steps to be listed on an exchange (using the public wifi, using the virtual person, using burner hardware, using the borrowed workspace)

- execute all the steps to be listed on CoinMarketCap

3. Grow the fund

- Create a public facing website (using the virtual person) with dashboards on the historical performance of the speculative value and the performance of the individual cryptocurrency and ico picks. The purpose of this is to attract more capital.

4. Exiting the project

- if people start to get uncomfortably close to an identity, leave the project, never speak about it again, destroy all burner hardware and electronic evidence

- take your coins and run? lol

To wipe these messages and all signal messages at anytime just go to the gear and 'deleted account'. You can then start over with a phone number.

About

Hi, my name is Mitch McLaughlin. I grew up in Iowa and I reside in San Francisco.
Over a year ago, I dropped out of university. While in school, I studied computer science and finance, played Division 1 basketball, and interned at GoPro and Oracle, respectively.

Immediately after leaving school, I traveled the world for 6 months.

I am not completely sure what I will do the rest of my life. But, I’m currently focusing on all things bitcoin & crypto. Also, I enjoy building things (like this server), readingand writing, exercising, and having fun.

An open letter to young people: the world is your playground. 06/21/2017

-never have to 'get a real job'

-never have to grow up in many of the ways traditionally thought

-do not necessarily have to have a family or get married

-you definitely dont need to go to college

-you do not necessarily have to take anyone's advice

-

You will be the richest generation.

You will be the most successful generation.

You will be the most misunderstood generation.

You will be the most criticized generation.

You will constantly fantasize about giving up and quitting. But, you wont.

You will be the most pressured generation.

You will be the most achieved generation at a young age.

Paradoxs 05/31/2017

Paradox of talent - the more talent that exists, the greater the outcome relies on luck.

Automation Paradox - as computer do work, the need for humans often increase

Fermi Paradox - If there are, as various arguments suggest, many other sentient species in the Universe, then where are they? Shouldn't their presence be obvious?

kafkaesque — unnecessary complicated and frustrating experiences (bureaucracy)

Drake Equation, which estimates the number of civilizations in our Galaxy whose signals we might be able to detect—potentially thousands

Murphy's Law - what can go wrong, will go wrong eventually

Gaian Bottleneck

Paradox of Information — more information is leading us to more irrational decisions

Gambler's fallacy - So, a roulette player watches as 7 black numbers come up in a row, so he puts all of his money on red. This well-known psychological process is called the gambler’s fallacy and is the mistaken belief that if an event happens repeatedly, a different event is imminent. In reality, the odds of any particular event occurring are always the same.


Moravec's paradox is the discovery by artificial intelligence and robotics researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, high-level reasoning requires very little computation, but low-level sensorimotor skills require enormous computational resources.

Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox Can far away events influence each other in quantum mechanics?

Faraday paradox An apparent violation of Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.

Blub Paradox - Cognitive lock of some experienced programmers that prevents them from properly evaluating the quality of programming languages which they do not know.

Paradox of luck - the more skill used, the greater the outcome relies on luck.

Abilene Paradox - People can make decisions based not on what they actually want to do, but on what they think that other people want to do, with the result that everybody decides to do something that nobody really wants to do, but only what they thought that everybody else wanted to do.

Peto's paradox Humans get cancer with high frequency, while larger mammals, like whales, do not. If cancer is essentially a negative outcome lottery at the cell level, and larger organisms have more cells, and thus more potentially cancerous cell divisions, one would expect larger organisms to be more predisposed to cancer.

Paradox of Plenty The Paradox of Plenty (resource curse) refers to the paradox that countries and regions with an abundance of natural resources, specifically point-source non-renewable resources like minerals and fuels, tend to have less economic growth and worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources.

Prisoners Dilemma - two prisoners might not cooperate even though it is in there best interest to do so.

Heuristics - mental shortcut/intuitive judgements

Ubiquitous - pervasive

Axiom - well-evident and established statement, that is accepted without controversy or question

Basketball: The Sport That Refuses To Die

If there is one team sport that survives the next 10,000 years, to me, it's basketball. Basketball is biologically pure, in a way that artificial technology will never be able to radically change.

Dedicated to the entire basketball community and to Dr. James Naismith,

Basketball is one of the most beautiful real-world team games ever invented and it's played at the intersection of culture, biology, technology, social science, psychology, politics and economics.

Basketball was created barely over 100 years ago. It's popularity has exploded, and it's probably the fastest growing sport ever created. For comparison, soccer was created over 2000 years ago.

When I started playing basketball as a young kid, I just played because my friends did it. Now, the game feels like one of the most uniquely intricate things played by some of the world’s highest-performing humans.

-the history of basketball

A game can be defined as, <i>“a form of play or sport, especially a competitive one played according to rules and decided by skill, strength, or luck.”<i>

The Canadian-born and United States immigrant, Dr. James Naismith invented the non-violent game of basketball in 1891. Other notable inventions in that decade included the internal combustion engine, automobiles, early airplanes, motion pictures, and remote controls. During that time, the Second Industrial Revolution was also well-underway. The telegraph, radio, railroad networks, gas and water supply, steam power, use of petroleum, use of machinery and manufacturing, and sewage systems were greatly expanded. During that same period, you might have crossed paths with influential people like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Ghandi, John D. Rockefeller, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, Andrew Carnegie, Florence Nightingale, Frederick Douglass, Oscar Wilde, H.G. Wells, Frank Lloyd Wright, James Joyce, Picasso, Mark Twain, Sigmund Freud, or Monet.

James Naismith was well-rounded, physically fit, voraciously intelligent, and a humble human-being. A student of his own body and mind, he experimented with many sports from a young age including: football, rugby, lacrosse, gymnastics, ice hockey, skating, and tobogganing. He would go on to graduate top 10 in his class with a degree in Philosophy and Hebrew from McGill University and eventually, earn his medical doctorate degree at Kansas University.

He combined his interest in spirituality and physical development to create the game of basketball. He differentiated the game of basketball from other sports by emphasizing skill, or finesse, as the most important feature rather than pure force. 

On a cold December day in 1891, the light-hearted optimist at 30 year-young walked into the YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts and among a handful of troubled youths and his supervisor, Luther Gulick, proceeded to climb a mini-ladder and nail 2 empty peach baskets 15 inches in diameter, 10 feet above the floor. They were located at opposite ends of the gymnasium each on the lower-side of the balcony. Shortly thereafter, his students would participate in the first game of basket-ball.

Basketball’s original rules were particularly designed to prevent and deter violence. Recent tragedies, like the ‘Malice at the Palace’ (pictured below) were not likely to be foreseen or approved of by Dr. James Naismith. Nonetheless, these types of events are exceedingly rare while the essence of the game remains mostly non-violent. Fouling violations also remain central to how the game is conducted. As Naismith originally described in 1 of the original 13 rules of basketball,

“No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.”

It turns out, 3 of the original 13 rules were explicitly written to deter fouling.

Another defining characteristic of the game of basketball is it's accessibility. It's made possible by requiring minimal equipment and the use of a multi-purpose, relatively compact playing surface. It can be played inside or out. The average court size is 84 by 50 feet (26 by 15 meters). It requires any round-ball with a circumference of roughly 30 inches (76 centimeters) and weighs roughly 20 ounces (0.5 kilograms). In the early days, the hoop was occasionally built using only a bucket and a standalone pole.

3 years before Dr. James Naismith’s death, at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, basketball was recognized as an official sport. Some believed Dr. Naismith’s net worth at the time of his death in 1939 was around $100 million. In typical Naismith fashion, he personally refrained from boasting about it.


Basketball as a social science

“Teams can become more than just a collection of people when a strong sense of mutual commitment creates synergy, thus generating performance greater than the sum of the performance of its individual members.”

If you’ve ever wondered why the game of basketball is fulfilling to players, many might cite something similar to the quote above. You can always spot a special team when you see one. Their execution is mechanical. They conduct everything from team meals to pre-game warmups rhythmically. It's orchestrated and systematic. The nuanced beauty and sophistication of their performance can leave observers amazed. The gossip surrounding their play might even be attributed to a divine power. If you can personally recall losing to such a team, it may have felt as if losing was inevitable. This type of teams attention to detail, effort, and preparation is astounding. They can influence you into weakness and hopelessness. Metaphorically, they can reach deep into your soul, crush it, and derive pleasure from it. “What the fuck just happened?” you might utter while recalibrating your mental state.

What's less clear is how these caliber of teams take shape. Many eat team meals together, watch film, practice, do community service, attend chapel, and go on team retreats. A likely catalyst for team-building is when members share intimate details about their personal lives. For example, how it felt to grow up with no real family. Or how it felt when their father died. Or what it's like growing up mentally disabled. Or what it was like growing up addicted to drugs. Athletes can be incredibly complex, neurotic, and broken. Often they are not, but they are humans. When teammates disclose these uniquely human vulnerabilities it often solidifies mutual cooperation, trust, commitment, sacrifice, and reciprocity. This leads to a deep interconnectedness between players, coaches, and community. This is foundational to what's referred to as a ‘winning culture’.

Intentionally or not, every team develops a culture. Examples of a great culture might include never leaving the gym without completing a workout and going beyond what was initially asked. Or cleaning-up dirty laundry, food crumbs after meals, taking care of ill teammates, fixing broken lockers, moping the floor after practice, or making friends with the disabled because it's the right thing to do. Some say, “Those are not direct inputs for determining the outcome of games.” And I would agree. Doing your laundry does not actually put points on the scoreboard. However, it misses the point. The point is viewing the game of basketball, or more broadly life, idealistically. Working together toward ideals has proven to be far more effective in team success. Being idealistic is by definition unachievable and somewhat irrational. But in this case, I’d argue chasing crazy is the best strategy.

, some might say. “You will never be undefeated.” But, I’d disagree. It’s actually a more board, and deeply logical approach to producing greatness. At the individual level, it fosters an intellectually fit and discipline mind. This approach is philosophical in nature.

I don’t believe the mentioned examples in the preceding paragraphs are unexpected. But, these are exactly the atomic mechanics of human cooperation to transcend individual performance. It's social science.

Social science also deals with individuality. Individuality is art. And art is at it's core a social activity. The best basketball players, knowingly or not, are artists. They play the game to display their skill and imagination. Their style is imitated and remixed amongst the entire basketball community. Sometimes playing style cannot be ordinarily explained or measured. Why would a player celebrate in that manner? Why is that player dancing? How did a player do that move? Why does that player do that before every game? What is that player wearing? Why do the players get excited from a dunk? A player’s identity and style is an expression of the totality of relationships and learnings from their life. 

It's all a form of expression. It's art.

That is, games allow us to avoid boredom.

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/History_of_sport

The history of sports may[original research?] extend as far back as the beginnings of military training, with competition used as a means to determine whether individuals were fit and useful for service. Team sports may have developed to train and to prove the capability to fight and work together as a team (army). The history of sport can teach us about social changes and about the nature of sportitself,[citation needed] as sport seems[original research?] involved in the development of basic human skills. Of course, as one goes further back in history, dwindling evidence makes theories of the origins and purposes of sport more and more difficult to support.

basketball as psychology

“90% of this game is mental, the other half is physical.” - Yogi Berra

-player talking to himself

-interactions between players and coaches

-interactions between players and parents

To be honest, a large part of the athletic mental approach is also machine-like. Athletes don't exactly experience the world in the same way as the average person.

Basketball as a biological science

-body, mind, and nutrition

Sports are the pinnacle of biological science. Athletes operate at the highest-level of physical performance. From a very young age, athletes and their teachers plant fundamental biological seeds that transform skilled amateurs into sophisticated, highly coordinated biological machines.

Basketball as political science



Basketball as economics

Money follows the game of basketball. Professional players and coaches are signing enormous contracts while turnover rates continue to increase. Athletes at the collegiate level are monetized. Every aspect of the game is about performance. At the highest-levels, the game has become business-like.

“Moving On From Basketball”

https://www.theplayerstribune.com/paul-pierce-one-final-season/

“The death of something we intensely love is a death within ourselves. When something we love dies, part of us dies with it. Hence the suffering. Such is the suffering a parent experiences at the death of a child. The most painful of all experiences is personal death. The second most painful experience is the death of someone else.”

For some time, I have had the desire to reflect on basketball. It's important I do it while my playing experiences are still fresh. I consider in retirement of my competitive career. Although I will play basketball recreationally for a good remainder of my life, my competitive playing career is selectively finished.

A lot of people over the years have asked me about my basketball career. Most of the time, my answer consisted of one sentence. I was too lazy keep repeating myself and elaborating on the entire story. Just like any other high-stake and intricate experiment, the initial results often don’t make sense. I am going to attempt to explain to the best of my ability why I think I underachieved. But, I want you to know, even now I have a hard time myself discerning how, why, and what went wrong. I thought had all the right ingredients, but things never quite turned out. It was messy. It was complex. I always wanted to write this post because I wanted to give myself closure.                          

people a complete, frank, and transparent answer.

In any other solar system, shooting a ball through a hoop 18-inches in diameter and 10-feet high mounted to a backboard would seem strange.


I underachieved in my basketball career. I can take some responsibility for it, but in many ways severe injuries sent me down a path I could not recover from. My second year at Drake, I completely tore the outer ligament of my thumb on my shooting hand. I was in a cast for 10 weeks. I was devastated. One of the lesser talked about issues in athletics is the side-effects following a serious injury. For many athletes it can be a very dark and lonely time period. For some, it's debilitating. In the most extreme psychological cases, it can end careers.

If muscles are *mildly* active the human body recovers quickly to peak performance. The body feels fresh and rustiness disappates quickly. But, if you ask anyone who has torn a major ligament or broke a bone, it's likely they will tell you they had to start all over reteaching the injured part how to work. The plasticity with which the human body learns and unlearns movements is both incredible and terrifying, just like technology.

A guard in basketball is the David of David vs. Goliath. If David is operating at peak performance and leveraging technology, he is super effective. More so than brute stength (Goliath). However, when David is impaired physically or not fully utilizing his intellect he often gets completely dominated.

In basketball, your user interface is your legs, arms, hands, and body. But, I injured my shooting hand severely twice (once at Drake, and once at Elmhurst, both in preseason). An injury is the equivalent of your iPhone’s touch screen not responding. How was I suppose to compete without the full-functionality of my device?

http://www.axonpotential.com/athletes-and-age-of-peak-performance/

The consistency of this rise-peak-decline pattern is striking, even across very different sports. For nearly every major sport, the age of peak performance is in the range of 22-30, and some interesting trends emerge when you look at sport type in relation to an athlete’s peak age. The age at which performance tends to peak across sports seems to mirror the continuum from purely explosive, athletic sports to slower, more skill-based sports, with explosive sports peaking earlier. Further, even within sports that combine different abilities, explosive abilities (e.g. base stealing in baseball) tend to peak earlier than more cognitive, skill-based abilities (e.g. drawing walks in baseball).
* For baseball, a number of studies, using different methods, have pegged peak age between 27-29. (Link) * For Tennis, peak age has been pegged between the early 20′s and 25. (Link) * For basketball, peak age has been found to be at 27 for all positions, with different positions showing different patterns of decline. (Link) * For Track and Field, peak sprinting age has been found to be in the lower-mid twenties, with endurance events having older peak ages. (Link) * For golf, athletes have broader peaks–between 25-35, with slower declines. (Link) * For football, running backs and receivers peak around 27, with running backs showing sharper fall-offs than receivers. Quarterbacks have a broader peak between 25-35. (Link)

Agassi’s knowing laugh echoes his belief that “you can’t spread who you are without being broken first. Sometimes, when you’ve been broken into pieces, you come back and give much more to people. You can see my scars and they’re key to me making a difference in other lives now. You can’t have any wounds in this game that don’t leave scars. They never quite heal but they make you who you are.”

Moving On

Surely he misses the intensity? “I miss that the least. That was always the tough part for me. I enjoyed the work that went into making yourself the best you can be but I hated what the scoreboard doesn’t say. It just tells you if you won or lost. But the biggest issue for most athletes is you spend a third of your life not preparing for the next two-thirds. One day your entire way of life comes to an end. It’s a kind of death. You just have to go through it and figure it out. In her own quiet way Steffi feels stronger than me. She’s pretty linear in how she lives. I probably do a little more reminiscing than she does – which says a lot.”

Over reliance on talent:

But he has so much athleticism he has a tendency to rely on that and make matches harder than they need to be.

The game also changed the way people view the world. Some people and kids love basketball so much, they devote their lives to the game. Basketball is everything to some people, like me. Also, many kids are trying harder in school to keep their grades up so they can play sports like basketball. Professional athletes talk to schools about kids dropping out of school.  They tell them it's not the right thing to do and that they need to stay in school so when they get older they can get a good job. Many kids set high goals for themselves to achieve, like being the best basketball player. For some, the sport is more than a game, it's a passion (Dr. James Naismith-The inventor of Basketball). This is why basketball changes the way people think about everything.

10. Today, some 400 million people worldwide play basketball, making it the second-most popular sport in the world, according to the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).

What my project is: An open-source software protocol, a purely-functional programmable blockchain.

Why I am doing it: 

I think we all wake up everyday and want to do our part in making the world a better place. My project just happens to be the next launching point in a vision I have carefully refined through worldly experiences my 24 years of life. A vision that fundamentally is built on serving others. My project also happens to be at a stage where the window of opportunity for financial support aligns nicely. Finances aside, I would like you to feel personally welcome and connected to all the highs and lows a successful project can have.

Before I introduce the project, I think it's important to explain my world view. I’d prefer to omit or postpone discussion of my accomplishments because they could be overshadowed by my values and what I stand for. 

I have been very lucky so far in my life. For quite some time, I have been at peace and appreciative of whatever the remaining days of my life will bring. I do not feel like I have anything to prove to anybody, although I remain highly-motivated. I am not inspired by revenge or hatred or money or any shifty notion of success. The only metric I derive my self-worth from is how much joy, opportunity, fairness, and love I am able to bring to others. And that leads me to this project.

Software is one way nerds are able to express utopian world views in a virtual environment. A creation can be as perfect as it's creator forges it to be. And it can convey meaning in a way that is unconventional, transcendent, and enduring. That is the connection I feel to my project.

My project is an open-source software protocol. It lives in the Bitcoin/crypto world. It arose from a few years of research and from observing the shortcomings and philosophical differences with the current state of cryptocurrency protocols. It's a highly-flexible and purely-functional programmable blockchain.

A purely-functional programmable blockchain assumes a few unprecedented shifts in the history of software and more broadly the world. It assumes the future of democracy is a layer on top of the internet and is manifested through software. It assumes peer-to-peer networking software can provide opportunities to global citizens who are marginalized by flawed institutions. It assumes financial outcomes in a software world can be positive-sum. It assumes culture and politics is on the verge of becoming increasingly unstable. These are just a few of the empirical observations that have pushed me into the Bitcoin/crypto space.

The technical ingredients of a purely-functional programmable blockchain are fairly simple. It leverages functional programming characteristics with regards to how it handles algorithms and data. I have not finished thinking through all the technical details, but the tech will be written in a Lisp-style language. Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on OOP (object-oriented) principles. This predisposes their technology to favor applications requiring medium-to-high data rigidity. But, a functional blockchain is fundamentally a more elegant and a differentiated approach for applications requiring secure, highly mutable data structures.

When I left school, turned down appealing full-time software opportunities, and entered the crypto space I was very anxious and had no idea where I was would end up. But, all I knew was I wanted to pursue the most ambitious path I could find. That is this project. I kindly ask you to consider it. Thank you so much.

An estimated timeline(roughly):

3-4 months out (by end of July): A completed technical white paper. And I will begin looking/adding technical contributors to the project if I have not already done so.

4-10 months out: A fully tested, production ready v1.0 launch/release. A publicly-available initial coin offering to offer shares in the growth of the protocol. It can serve as continued funding.

12+ months out: Continue testing and implementing new features, preparing to scale the network, and continued growth of the community.

Follow-up Q&A

I think I answered the why questions in the essay. But, I will add a few specific responses.

Q: What is this project doing for people?

A: Makes the best finance and political platform accessible to all global citizens. Provides state-of-the-art tools for the top software developers to build apps.

Q: Does it create a lot of value for a few people or some value for a lot of people?

A: Both. It will bring opportunities to the masses and provides great value to a select group of talented developers.

Q: How does our grant help enable progress?

A: It will serve as a bridge until the project is publicly launched.

Q: Are you working on it?

A: Yes.

Q: What do you see as success working on this project?

A: Success is very simply the continued development of the protocol, the tools, and the community.

Q: What is the current state of the project?

A: Research and writing of the technical white paper.

Q: What do you think you’ll be able to accomplish during the program?

A: My estimated timeline for deliverables (roughly):

3-4 months out (by end of July): A completed technical white paper. And I will begin looking/adding technical contributors to the project if I have not already done so.

4-10 months out: A fully tested, production ready v1.0 launch/release. A publicly-available initial coin offering to offer shares in the growth of the protocol. It can serve as continued funding.

12+ months out: Continue testing and implementing new features, preparing to scale the network, and continued growth of the community.

What worries Pentagon planners most is that the Russians appear to be looking for vulnerabilities at much greater depths, where the cables are hard to monitor and breaks are hard to find and repair.

The end of money. /self expression/Experience(s) are(is) the blood that flows thru our economy.

Happiness is not always intentional. Experiences are not always intentional. Creation is not always intentional.

What is money?

What is the economy?

capitalism/Money is a great enabler of technology. Mixes art & science.

What happens when we think ourselves out of the economic systems? We have become so efficient, profits are zero.

If profits are zero,

Current system ... People technology capital output ROI

Future people tech/tools output entirely psychological rewards.

What would it mean to have power if money isn't the metric/indicator? How do you measure psychological power? Peace of mind? Power of mind?

Bell curve of fulfillment.

More people getting more fulfilled overall then any other time in history.

Quality of life? Not just measured by income. Will be measured by psychological fulfillment.

Psychological formula = sacrifice, discipline, mental energy output comraderie fulfillment accomplishment

The barrier to global impact (creation) is being reduced. The formula for creation is becoming simpler. Work/focus people tech/tools

3 billion ppl. A fraction of that pool now has access to creation. Even if it's a small fraction, the results/output will result in exponential gains.

Humans will always be tool makers. Humans are enablers?

The experience economy. Transcended good & services. Paying for experiences. Experience vs service.

The beginning of the end of 'money' as we know it has arrived. These bills we use, metal we exchange, and the different currencies will be meaningless. 

We are all going to have no money. The world will run on happiness & fulfillment.

All we are doing is trading experiences, and everyone else will soon be too.

The strange thing is life had never been about money, it's always been about happiness and experiences. Because we have been deceived. Happiness is simple it appears "too easy to be true" meanwhile money appears too make things easier but it adds complex it because of too many options.

Here's why having no money is actually a good thing. Money is just a store of value, however nothing forbids a persons characteristics as being a store of value. Imagine this scenario, Fred is the wealthiest/most successful person in the world he has accumulated 6 doodads (insert creativity metric here) of creativity! Amazing! The rest of the world has only accumulated 0.1 doodads combined. And as the world gets more individualized, our personality traits may become to the new 'currency'.

How did we measure wealth before money?

Today, money allows people to do many things, exchange goods and services, gamble, invest, buy time/convince, donate to charity, and impact the works in many awesome ways.

Let's examine the richest people in the world & what they do with their money & why they spend it the way they do.

Gates buffet zuck etc

Money is just a tool for them to do much bigger things. To make changes in the world. Money controls the political process PACs. They don't actually care about money. Money doesn't provide them happiness. Helping others does. Giving others opportunities does. Not because they need to see others succeed but more simply because it's the right thing to do. Morality is the driver of these elites ambitions.

One day a consesious will be reached where money has no value, intrinsically or psychologically. It's entirely possible that the new measure of success/power/wealth will become creativity. Creativity or simply connecting dots will be the only value.

How done measure wealth today? Wealth can mean many things but when it comes to money one of the best metrics or indicators may very well be the Forbes list. One could argue these are worlds most powerful people. When we transcend the world of money, it begs the question.

How will we measure creativity in this future civilization? It's really tough today to measure creativity. If you talk to intelligent people the best indicator they suggest is "follow your intuition". Well that couldn't be more ambiguous. But in tomorrow's world we will demand new metrics to measure an individual's creativity.

"Follow your passion" "don't follow your passion" how about do what makes you happy. And who gives a fuck about how much money we make.

AI if the network of all human brains are working together and activated, vs all of the machine intelligent

Our data will be the blood that powers the Artificial Intelligence.

when we first thought about artificial intelligence & the singularity we feared machine intelligence would transcend human intelligence (see Elon Musk & Bill Gate posts here, document to warn of superhuman AI). however, we didn’t acknowledge that human brains operate as a network NOT isolation. If you can imagine, we zoom out from one individual’s brain and take a look collectively at ALL human brains we see a much more powerful network of human intelligence at work. There’s good and bad news. The bad news is, if humanity is negligent we could be outcompeted(via natural selection) by a network of machine intelligence and it could spell the end of the human race. The good news is today, 9-22-2015, we control our destiny because generations & generations before us have crafted a foundation of intelligence that has given us an advantage. And we must work hard to get the remaining world’s brains online and contributing to our world’s intelligence, I am optimistic the world’s collective human brain can and will out compete the network of machine intelligence. Furthermore, I’m willing to bet if we believe in hard work, faith, the good of humanity, karma, or whatever it is, we can will prevail.

The weird thing about this new world that may come about is the fact that humans and machines will coexist enduring constant stress & anxiety over competitive pressures. The world is getting increasingly competitive. We may be on the verge of a new Cold War against machines.

our characters lie on a continuum and things change. this is why we sympathize with those who currently reside on the wrong side of the continuum. https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/05/11/out-of-character/

THE BLENDING OF THE CLIENT AND THE SERVER ARCHITECTURE

thoughts

What the Nazi generals taught me about human nature.

I sat in the Topography of Terror Museum, once the residence of Himlivk Himler, the SS (Nazi Police), the Gustapo(), and all those leaders who negligently participated in genocide. I felt at peace in their presence. Just as I am attuned with my own sins. We must all embrace the darkness in our hearts and prevail with the power of good. Don't let the evils overcome.

I could hear Himlick Homler speaking to me, "I am sorry, I did so many bad things to so many people, including endangering my family. If I had to do it over again, I would do everything different."

And we whispered, "it's ok, we forgive you."

Eureka, just a chain reaction of neurons connecting and boom! Something completely unique happens never ever again to be copied.


TIL the guillotine was invented in 1789 in France, and capital punishment by guillotine existed in France until 1982.

TIL Mr. Joseph Guillotine did not actually invent the guillotine. It was actually invented by Tobias Schmidt.

TIL Mr. Guillotine invented the toilet.

TIL the first modern genocide actually occurred during an anti-Republic uprising in the French Revolution.

TIL Campus originates as latin word meaning “in the fields”. When education became secular during the Middle Ages, teaching took place “in the fields” and this is how the term came to be.

TED Remix

The miracle of your mind is that you can see the world as it isn't. We can imagine the future, we can remember the past.

The miracle of your mind is that you can see the world as it isn't. We can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place.

We need to think big, we need to think cheap, we need to think about the problem differently.

We owe it to our children & grandchildren.

We can't just bomb our way out, were gunna invent our way out, working together.

We have the tools, we have the passion; we can be more, we can be much more.

The city of the future calls on you, to see it thru, will you dream with me, will you build with me?

We have 3 billion new minds coming online, to do that which we must do.

A Gift. The most special gifts I ever received weren't given to me because someone "had to" or because it was Christmas. The gifts themselves were just thoughtful. This doesn't mean gifts can't be special on holidays, anniversaries, or the like. But, it does mean
Great gifts are not a function of the calendar day rather it is how much thought was invested.

When you give a gift it becomes a symbol for a shared secret between 2 people.

Almost always you have a preexisting relationship with the person you gave the gift to. So what's really happening is the gift symbolizes all of the experiences, or more broadly the happiness enjoyed in the relationship. Maybe is why sentimental gifts are the best. Because it's not about how much it costs, or how materially pleasing it is, rather how unique it is.

Instead of thinking about applying to 'a job' try to think about applying to 'an area of jobs'. What this means is your skills are likely to have crossover into adjacent positions. Reason is, many companies will reach when hiring interns if they believe your motivation to learn outweigh your compatibility with the desired job requirements. This is true because interns have time or room for growth. It's important to note the farther in your career your are the harder it is to get a company to 'reach' on you. Although not impossible. So use your youth as an advantage.

Collective intelligence is all we have. Decentralized decision making.

Open sourcing isn't about making money. It's about survival. We're protecting our race from whatever species arises.

A Reminder To Myself About Having Fun

--- Having fun is underrated.

The saddest thing I see is having the option and passing up fun experiences in life. Life is too short, we take life so seriously and 

I'm not sure why. Maybe its human nature to pity ourseleves. Its easy, its a trap.

 The feeling when him experience a moment or laughter with friends of getting lost on the moment. Nothing can match that, no amount or money can compensate for that. This is why a friendship always trumps money. Laughter is scientifically a stress relief. Happiness is a very fragile item and you have to protect it, feed it, and foster its growth. I've witness some or my best friends walking the thin line between happiness and depression. Some fell down the slippery slope of chronic unhappiness after a few critical things didn't go their way. By no means was it their fault. Sometimes you just get dealt a terrible hand. I lost a good friend and close teammate of mine Conlon White at a young age. I struggled for a long time on how to handle it and how to move on. I think writing these words is helping me cope with his loss which I can not ever forget. An innocent life gone. I miss you Conlon.

As with the seed of life happiness is more fragile when we are younger. Its naturally immature and weak. If I had go bet id say suicide rates among those under 21 is higher than those over 21 for this reason.

When you are feeling sad you have go train ourselves to recognize it. Take a day off, feed your soul, have some fun.

Too much fun can similiarly be dangerous. When all you do is fun, its not fleeting anymore, its yihr life. Its value is diluted because its no longer scarce. human nature allows to stop appreciating it. I vividly remember the look in a persons eyes

NOMADS

Shifting to the nomadic life

The reality of the changing environment is nomadic living is much more economically scalable than the current environment.

Being nomadic means independence and freedom.

Being a nomad means independence and freedom. It means continuously gaining new experiences. It means full-time education. It means making connections. It means having opportunities. It means doing self-experiments. And it’s all that, all in one. Massive, isn’t it? Yes

But I’m not even just talking about the constant state of movement when I talk about the nomadic freedom lifestyle. Above all, being a nomad is a mindset.

It’s a temporary state for those of us in a lower income demographic.

The world is already in a state of financial uncertainty and instability and the trend will continue increasing.

Recently, I’ve had an increasing amount of folks who are picking up everything & leaving their home for a different life.

Renting is basically throwing money away. Seriously. My fellow SF intern and roommate Jay Ives and I split a 1BR apartment in Nob Hill totaling $4000/mo.

Work out the numbers.

Even though renting is an economic nightmare. Owning a home is even scarier. Then you really can’t move at all.

but my time on the road showed me that more and more stateside Millennials are traveling and living abroad as well.

According to a report by Boston Consulting Group, Millennials are traveling despite our collective $322 billion in student debt. In 2010, our travel spending rose 10%, and we’re the fastest growing age segment in travel spending. But this money isn’t just going towards vacation.

Many of us are building lifestyles around location independence. We’re becoming nomadic.

Supranational borders is going to increase in significance.

So while so many of us might not be “settling down” like our parents had hoped, we’re building lifestyles that allow us to see more of the world, and collecting a greater variety of experiences by keeping our options open.

Conquering the world. (Via travel)

You would need…

Control of the money.

Control of the banks.

Control of trade.

Control of energy.

Control of the food.

Control of healthcare.

Control of medicine.

Control of education.

Control of the military.

Control of dissent.


The world is far to large. 7 billion people, 200 millions of square miles of land, and millions of interest points. Given unlimited money you could maybe do it all. The world can not be conquered. 

With the help of others, we have a slim chance to conquer 1% of the world.

If we are kind and selfless, along the journey of life we will run into some caring people, and they may help us conquer a small fraction of the world. The best case scenario for an individual is conquering 1% of the world, average case is 0.00001%, worst case around 0.0000000001%. Life is to insignificant to take serious. No one gives a shit. 99% of humanity will never care about my life or your life. That is a fact.

Some of us may have a clear and defined purpose, some of us may float. Neither of us is wrong.

I love talking to people who society considers "failures" and to me they are living their best possible life.

I'm arguing for appreciating the fragile & beautiful moments we experience everyday. The moments we expect to always be there.

The emotional moments. Hearing the voice of parents. Laughing with friends. Physical love of a companion. Crying, being alone, scared, death and helplessness. We all feel it, why would we be scared of it. It is meant to be celebrated. While we search for whatever life is supposed to be. Some feel good and some terrible. Doesn't matter, what we feel makes us alive.

We want more money, we are not happy. We want to get married, we want to be single. We want to have kids, we don't want responsibility. We want to be famous, we don't want the headaches. We want more vacation, we are not fulfilled. We want more friends, we feel more alone. We want to be nice, we want to be evil. We want to be proper, we want to be sloppy. We want to travel, we want to go home. We want chaos, we want order. People call us crazy. But that's who we are.

The Internet is really good at explaining the macro, but the micro must be experienced to understand the whole.

The best opportunities are invisible.

I've been preparing for this day for a long long time.

I picked my mom up. Bare, helpless, frail, vulnerable, innocent, and weightless. I've never experienced something so beautiful. All that remained was her warm love in her heart. I'll fight till my very last day too. I love you mom. You are my god.

CHRISTMAS

The first and last Christmas without my family.

To: Mom, Dad, Brother, and my extended family. With love ❤️.

Sorry, Mom & Dad & Brother I could not be at Christmas this year. I can’t imagine how it must have felt. I’m sorry I was not able to hand you the latest & greatest gifts I planned to give you.

I’m in a unfamiliar place half way across the world. Alone, it sucks, but being in a dark place gives me a unique perspective. Stripping away the formalities of Christmas I can see the real reasons why Christmas is so special.

We are all luckily to receive gifts each year. The best gifts are exceptionally thoughtful. We tend to think of gifts as boxes under the tree which take place a given calendar day. But, gifts can be special on any day of the year & they may not have wrapping paper. It might be something we can not touch, it might be a fleeting moment with a family member, or it might be continuous and on-going experience like a relationship.

The best gifts I have are relationships. Particularly, the one I have with you. I love you all and I will especially appreciate the moments I will have with you for the rest of my life.

-Mitch

Most notably, with my parents. They are in their mid-50s. Before I left for college, I saw them almost everyday living at home (300 days a year). Now, I see them only a handful of times each year (maybe 10 days a year). I would like to be optimistic and say I’m lucky both of them are still alive. My parents and I have roughly 40 years left of coexistence, best case scenario. I could argue I have already spent 90% of the total days with my parents when I lived at home. Only 10% remains in the final 40 years.

Despite not being at the end of my life, I may very well be near the end of my time with the most important people in my life. I can draw out the total days spent with my parents, it becomes even more clear.

It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.

It’s a similar story with my two sisters. After living in a house with them for 10 and 13 years respectively, I now live across the country from both of them and spend maybe 15 days with each of them a year. Hopefully, that leaves us with about 15% of our total hangout time left.

The same often goes for old friends. In high school, I sat around playing hearts with the same four guys about five days a week. In four years, we probably racked up 700 group hangouts. Now, scattered around the country with totally different lives and schedules, the five of us are in the same room at the same time probably 10 days each decade. The group is in its final 7%.

So what do we do with this information?

Setting aside my secret hope that technological advances will let me live to 700, I see three takeaways here:

1) Living in the same place as the people you love matters. I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else.

2) Priorities matter. Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you—not by unconscious inertia.

3) Quality time matters. If you’re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you’re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious.

Someone recently said "you read so slow!". I started to wonder, does reading slower correlate to intelligence?

Do not ever forget empathy you had. People are fucking suffering. Help them. Just because someone made one bad trajectory decision does not mean then deserve to suffer. We are human.

History the Web

https://eager.io/blog/the-history-of-the-url-domain-and-protocol/

OpenVPN

OpenVPN uses the underlying cryptographic mechanism of SSL/TLS to secure a VPN connection, but the web analogy stops there. OpenVPN can best be understood as a portable, user-space VPN implementation which uses SSL/TLS as its underlying cryptographic engine. 

OpenVPN is able to use the same public key infrastructure as Apache, but is otherwise not related to the secure web.

GREAT QUESTIONS: How do we minimize the amount of manual configuration required? How do we streamline the key management process? I would argue that it would be premature to codify the user-space VPN model into a standard until we have a better handle on the usability and management issues.
